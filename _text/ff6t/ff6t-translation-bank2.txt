[NEWPAGE]
"We got it off a monster named
[SPACE_07]Deathgaze."
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: My lands! You actually
downed that ancient beast!?
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: Deathgaze is-- I mean,
was, a legendary monster.
He's even mentioned in some
ancient books I've collected.
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: I can't believe someone
actually took down that fiend…
Just incredible!
[NEWPAGE]
Oh, here! [LONGPAUSE]Take this with you!
--------------------
Lure monsters onto the Veldt?
[CHOICE] Yes, please
[CHOICE] No, thank you
--------------------
Owzer: You managed to beat a
legendary monster. No doubt
you have what it takes to save
our world, too.
[NEWPAGE]
I know it's not much, but I'm
rooting for you. Go show the
world what you're made of!
--------------------
Owzer: Hmm… I have a fine
idea.
[NEWPAGE]
If you DO save the world,
perhaps I'll celebrate by
painting your portraits for
display in my gallery.
--------------------
[CELES]: I'll go to the Empire
alone. I'm the most familiar
with its inner workings.
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: But won't it be
too dangerous by yourself…?
--------------------
[CELES]: …M- [LONGPAUSE]me?
--------------------
[CELES]: Now just a minute…
--------------------
[CELES]: H-hold on here! [LONGPAUSE]
I'm a former general, not
some opera floozy!
--------------------
[CELES]: [LOCKE]. [LONGPAUSE]
Why did you help me back
then?
--------------------
[CELES]: Am I just a
replacement… [LONGPAUSE]for her?
--------------------
[CELES]: I have to go on
stage soon. This next scene's
an important one.
[NEWPAGE]
Maria starts to worry that
something's happened to Draco,
and pours her feelings into
song.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: You're a natural,
[CELES].
[CELES]: Quit teasing me!
--------------------
[CELES]: Here he comes.
--------------------
[CELES]: [SETZER], we need
your help. We need to get to
Vector. Your ship is the only[64][64]
--------------------
[CELES]: Wait! [LONGPAUSE]
We heard that your ship is the
finest vessel in the world.
--------------------
[CELES]: You're not the only
one suffering.
[NEWPAGE]
The Empire has been toppling
towns and villages left and
right…
--------------------
[CELES]: We're at least
together in hating the Empire,
right? [LONGPAUSE]So, please…
[NEWPAGE]
[SETZER]: You know, I think
you may be even prettier than
Maria.
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Huh?
--------------------
[CELES]: …Fine.
--------------------
[CELES]: But only on one
condition.
--------------------
We flip this coin. If it's heads
you help us. If it's tails, I'm
yours. [LONGPAUSE]
Well, [LONGPAUSE]Mr. Gambler?
--------------------
[CELES]: Ready?
--------------------
[CELES]: Heads… I win.
Now it's time for you to hold
up your end of the bargain.
--------------------
[CELES]: I'm afraid you've
been hustled, Mr. Gambler. [LONGPAUSE]
But that's part of the game,
now, isn't it?
--------------------
[CELES]: No… [LONGPAUSE]
You see, [LONGPAUSE]I…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: [CELES]!
You… tricked us!?
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Of course not!
Please, trust me!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Hmph. I knew she
was not to be trusted!
--------------------
[CELES]: [LOCKE]… [LONGPAUSE]
It's my turn to protect you
now…

And then maybe… [LONGPAUSE]
…maybe you'll believe me.

Welcome to our school for
budding adventurers.
[NEWPAGE]
We're always here to help you
find your way in the world…
or at least what's left of it.
--------------------
Have the mimic or the yeti
teamed up with you? They can
equip magicite too, you know.
[NEWPAGE]
They can also summon espers
like normal, but they can't
learn magic.
--------------------
If you hold the B Button while
walking, you'll move twice as
fast!
--------------------
Apparently, there might be
places that are only accessible
when the lead party member
has certain status ailments.
--------------------
Some characters learn magic
naturally when leveling up.
[NEWPAGE]
These characters include
Magitek Soldiers, Rune Knights,
and Pictomancers.
--------------------
Relics don't remove existing
status ailments when equipped.
Keep that in mind!
--------------------
You can see detailed
information about equipment
by "double-clicking" them while
in the Item menu.
[NEWPAGE]
Press Left while on the details
screen to see even more
information about an item.
[NEWPAGE]
You can even see which special
abilities a piece of equipment is
compatible with.
[NEWPAGE]
You can also see which magic
spells a piece of equipment will
teach when equipped!
--------------------
There are some pieces of
equipment that won't be
auto-equipped if you use the
Equip menu's "BEST" command.
[NEWPAGE]
This includes special equipment
like the Atma Weapon and
absorption weapons like the
Blood Sword.
--------------------
New Game+ resets all treasure
chests, as well as which
monsters appear on the Veldt.

[CHOICE] No

causes petrification.
[NEWPAGE]
(Tornado)
Puts all enemies in a
near-death state. Doesn't hit

random. The total damage is

--------------------
(Two-Handed)
The attacker holds one weapon
in both hands. Inflicts double
the damage of a normal attack.
[NEWPAGE]
(Dual-Wield)
The attacker holds one weapon
in each hand. Each weapon
deals 3/4 normal damage.
[NEWPAGE]
(Physical/Magic Power Up)
These effects don't stack
across multiple relics or pieces
of equipment.
--------------------
Items with multiple elemental
types can still cause partial
damage when one elemental
type is nullified or absorbed.
--------------------
You can summon espers by
equipping magicite, you know.
You can summon them as many
times as you want per battle.
[NEWPAGE]
Espers are a great way to pack
a magical punch in battle!
--------------------
When you level up, your stats
will increase a random amount!
[NEWPAGE]
So if you run into a problem or
a foe you can't beat, try
leveling up before trying again.
--------------------
Shall I explain some blue magic
spells in detail?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No

after which the dancer can act
freely again.

Blind.
[NEWPAGE]
(Water Edge)
Deals water damage and inflicts
Mute.
[NEWPAGE]

--------------------
Shall I explain how the Sketch
ability works?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
(Sketch)
Attacks induced by the Sketch
command use the sketcher's
stats, not the enemy's.
[NEWPAGE]
It's possible to sketch without
a brush equipped. Equipping a
brush will increase the success
rate of the Sketch command.

Esper: I cannot allow you to go
any further…
--------------------
Esper: You… You have magicite?
[LONGPAUSE]Ah, it's you…!
--------------------
Esper: Ah, you're Maduin's… [LONGPAUSE]
[TERRA]: You know my
father…?
--------------------
Esper: You may pass. Our home,
the Esper Realm, lies ahead…
--------------------
This is the espers' village.
How long it's been since a
human last visited…
--------------------
Eek! [LONGPAUSE]Humans!
[NEWPAGE]
Sorry, you surprised me.
I've never talked to a human
before…
--------------------
With the power of the Warring
Triad gone, this land is well on
its way to ruin too…
--------------------
I've heard about you guys.
You're the humans with our
magicite, right?
[NEWPAGE]
Take good care of them, okay?
Even though they're in magicite
form, it's still them in there.
--------------------
The elder's house is ahead.
I'm sure everything will be just
fine, but just in case, try not to
offend him.
--------------------
Sylph: I've infused this bell with
the magicites' power. With this,
you should be able to lift the
seal on Lady Ultima's shrine.
--------------------
Sylph: Lady Ultima's shrine is
supposedly north of a place
called the Dragon's Neck.
--------------------
Some especially powerful
enemies have unseen strength
that goes beyond what the
Libra spell will tell you.
--------------------
When an esper dies, it becomes
magicite. But, if enough time
passes, they will return to this
world.
[NEWPAGE]
Thus magicite represents both
death and the first step toward
new life.
--------------------
You're using us for war, yet
again… It's almost like nothing
has changed since the War of
the Magi 1000 years ago…
--------------------
Oh, you took the Lost Path to
get here? You must be
exhausted. Please feel free to
use the bed here.
--------------------
Elder: It's you…
--------------------
Never did I expect to see you
here… I am the ruler of this
realm.
[NEWPAGE]
"Our world has been…"
[NEWPAGE]
Elder: I know. Never in my all
my years did I expect a human
to usurp the power of the
Warring Triad…
[NEWPAGE]
Hear me, magicite bearers.
You are our only hope now.
We cannot control ourselves
when in your realm.
[NEWPAGE]
Yet, something must be done,
before the situation turns far
graver than the War of the
Magi…
[NEWPAGE]
"We're part of the problem.
[SPACE_07]We keep using magicite… and
[SPACE_07]your power… for our needs."
[NEWPAGE]
Elder: Not true. The magicite
you possess only works
because those espers have
deemed you worthy of heart.
[NEWPAGE]
We want you to use that
strength of heart to save both
your realm and ours.
--------------------
Elder: You are of strong and
gentle heart. Please use it to
replace the world's darkness
with light.
--------------------
Elder: !! [LONGPAUSE]
Oh, my stars! You're Maduin's
daughter…!
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: Yes. My name is
[TERRA].
--------------------
Elder: Ah, I see. [TERRA]… [LONGPAUSE]
You've grown so much…
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: So this is where my
father used to live?
[NEWPAGE]
Elder: Indeed. And it is where
you were born.
[NEWPAGE]
When everything happened back
then, I was powerless to save
your parents… [LONGPAUSE]I'm truly, truly
sorry.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: No, it's okay, sir.
It wasn't your fault at all.
[NEWPAGE]
Elder: [TERRA]…
Take this with you. It used to
belong to your father, Maduin.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: This was my
father's…?
[NEWPAGE]
Elder: You're all welcome here.
It's a small, simple village, but
I hope you'll enjoy your stay,
however long that may be.

Different abilities take
different amounts of time to
perform in battle.

Keep in mind that the stronger
the ability, the longer it takes
to perform.
[NEWPAGE]
This means that powerful
commands like Magic and
Bushido take longer to perform
than weaker ones.

Characters in the back row

Got it. Just a moment, please.
--------------------
I'm not sure when it happened,
but an octopus-like fellow
moved in to our village at some
point.
[NEWPAGE]
I don't recall there being any
espers who look like him,
though…
--------------------
Ultros: The espers have loads
of cute girls too, y'know.
--------------------
[RELM]: What are YOU doing
here, Ulty?
[NEWPAGE]
Ultros: N'ghaaa! [LONGPAUSE]Y-y-you! [LONGPAUSE]
I finally found you, pipsqueak!

[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Airship Model!
--------------------
This is the Mog House!
The save point here is special!
[NEWPAGE]
If you save your game here
and "transfer" the save file to
work with Final Fantasy VI
T-Edition EX…
[NEWPAGE]
…you'll be able to access an
entirely new bonus area with
super-challenging boss battles!
[NEWPAGE]
Basic Instructions:
1. Unlock the Mog House in
   FF6 T-Edition
[NEWPAGE]
2. Save the game at the save
   point inside the Mog House
   (To be safe, make a backup
   of your save file too)
[NEWPAGE]
3. Rename the FF6 T-Edition
   save file (usually a .srm
   file) to match the name
   of the EX game.
[NEWPAGE]
(For example, if the EX game is
called FF6T-EX.smc, rename
your save file to FF6T-EX.srm)
[NEWPAGE]
4. Load and play the EX game.
   If done correctly, it will
   recognize your FF6 T-Edition
   save file and load properly.
[NEWPAGE]
This is kind of complicated
stuff, so see the readme file
if you're having trouble
getting it to work.

At night, monsters crawl out of
the mine and come into town.
[NEWPAGE]
The city guards do conduct
patrols to keep us safe, but it's
a lot of work for so few
people.
[NEWPAGE]
So, if it isn't too much to ask,
could you deal with some of the
monsters before they take
over the town?
[NEWPAGE]
[CHOICE] Accept "Night Patrol"
[CHOICE] Decline
--------------------
Thank you! I'll go make
arrangements with the
innkeeper. The patrol will begin
after sundown.
--------------------
The mine is where all the
creatures come from. But you'll
need to take out all the
monsters along the way first.
[NEWPAGE]
The monsters leave before
sunrise. We'd like to wipe out
as many as we can, then take
the fight into the caves.
[NEWPAGE]
It's a tall order for us, but I
bet it'll be a walk in the park
for you.
[NEWPAGE]
All right, then. We're counting
on you! Good luck!
--------------------
"It's sunrise…"
"We didn't get rid of them all…"
--------------------
Hmm? Are you gonna call it
quits for tonight?
[CHOICE] We can keep going!
[CHOICE] We can't handle any more…
--------------------
The monsters don't seem
interested in breaking into our
houses, so we'll be okay for
tonight at least.
[NEWPAGE]
Thanks for your help. I hope
you'll lend a hand again
sometime!
--------------------
Urgh! These things just never
let up!
--------------------
Thanks! I owe you one!

Banon: Oh, it's you! [LONGPAUSE]
It seems the monsters are
coming from the snowfield
beyond the mines.
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: Don't push yourselves
too hard, you hear? If you get
hurt, come see me anytime.
--------------------
The monsters aren't that
strong, but they come every
single night. I never get enough
sleep anymore.
--------------------
Urgh! I'm sick and tired of you
monsters! Back off!
--------------------
Whew, I think I'll be okay now.
Thanks!
--------------------
"I think that's all of them."
"Let's check out the mines!"
--------------------
"There are still monsters in the
[SPACE_07]city!"
--------------------
"Are you okay!?"
[NEWPAGE]
Guard: Oww, oww… [LONGPAUSE]Good thing
all this snow was here to break
our fall…
--------------------
Guard: The lead monster is in 
the snowfield area ahead. But
be careful inside the mines.
They're filled with Snolls!
--------------------
"What now?"
"Let's talk to the person down
[SPACE_07]below."
--------------------
"That should do it, I think."
"Let's return to town."

Coliseum entrants must wager
items when they fight.
First, choose an item from your
inventory to wager.
[NEWPAGE]
But if you're carrying lots of
items, it'll be too hard to see
what you're betting if it's at
the bottom of your inventory.
[NEWPAGE]
So it's best to place the item
you want to wager near the
top of your inventory first.
[NEWPAGE]
Once you have chosen an item,
your opponent will appear.
Choose a party member to fight
that opponent.
[NEWPAGE]
A one-on-one battle will then
take place. You'll have to use
all of your strength and wits to
defeat your opponent!
[NEWPAGE]
The item you wagered serves
as your entry fee. But if you
win, you'll be rewarded with an
even better item!
[NEWPAGE]
That's all there is to it.
Good luck!

Banon: I wish I'd been given
more to do in the original
game…
--------------------
Arvis: Here's hoping for a patch
that adds me and Banon as full
party members!
--------------------
Duane: I'm sorry for all the
dumb stuff I've said!
[NEWPAGE]
Duane: Man… [LONGPAUSE]I'm such a loser in
the main game…
--------------------
Katarin: The children gave
Duane a real talking-to about
how he doesn't understand
girls at all.
--------------------
This music… It gives one the
feeling of a story beginning, or
of something ominous waiting
just over the horizon.
--------------------
This music nicely conveys what
the town of Narshe "feels"
like.
[NEWPAGE]
And is it just me, or is that the
sound of steam being released
into the cold air?
--------------------
There are many things that
can awaken in people, just as
there are many things that
people can awaken.
[NEWPAGE]
Hidden inner strength, for
example, or determination born
from uncertainty.
--------------------
This music fills me with strong
feelings of courage.
[NEWPAGE]
It reminds me that no matter
how difficult things get, there
will always be a path forward
if you keep looking ahead.
--------------------
Pointless fighting only leads to
sorrow, but sometimes fighting
is necessary to survive.
[NEWPAGE]
That's the thought that comes
to mind as I listen to this tune.
--------------------
This is a fanfare played for the
victors, after a battle is won.
But, then, what music is played
for the losers, I wonder…
--------------------
A mechanical castle, floating in
a vast sea of sand…
[NEWPAGE]
This music brilliantly captures
the Figaro Kingdom's fiery
spirit that burns hotter than
the desert itself.
--------------------
Ah, the whimsical melody of a
clown.
[NEWPAGE]
Deep within its guise of
innocence lurks a hidden
madness. But, what, in turn,
lurks within that madness?
--------------------
Mt. Kolts has served as a
training spot since time
immemorial.
[NEWPAGE]
As this adventurous tune hits
my ears, I can't help but
imagine braving the sacred
mountain's challenges myself.
--------------------
The Returners… A resistance
group that opposes the
Empire.
[NEWPAGE]
This music nicely conveys the
covert, rebellious spirit that
drives every one of its
members.
--------------------
An assassin who has silenced
his own soul…
[NEWPAGE]
I can almost hear this music
accompanying him as he
wanders the wastelands all
alone.
--------------------
This music captures the image
of the mighty Empire's soldiers
marching into battle.
--------------------
A samurai who wields his
katana for what he believes in.
[NEWPAGE]
This music conveys his sheer
strength of will to keep moving
forward, in spite of the great
sorrow he carries with him.
--------------------
This is the sound of intense
anger translated into music.
[NEWPAGE]
Its quick tempo accurately
expresses the fiery feelings
that come with anger.
--------------------
This mysterious, otherworldly
melody portrays the beauty
and quietness of the Phantom
Forest.
--------------------
This haunting, enigmatic music…
[NEWPAGE]
It truly befits the idea a
"phantom" train that carries
the souls of the dead to the
afterlife.
--------------------
This music boasts such wild
power… The sound of it fires
up everyone who hears it.
--------------------
Oh, what soothing music…
It makes me feel warm and
happy inside, like I'm sitting in
a nice, sunny spot.
--------------------
The Serpent Trench stretches
along the ocean floor. Who
knows what could be lurking in
its underwater depths…
--------------------
This music evokes the image of
a peaceful town filled with
hope.
[NEWPAGE]
You can almost hear the
laughter of children in the
distance as the melody plays.
--------------------
Loneliness… Insecurity… Fear…
This music seems to embody
the uncertainty felt by people
who have been conquered.
--------------------
"O my hero, my beloved,
[SPACE_07]shall we still be made to
[SPACE_07]part…?"
[NEWPAGE]
I can't help but hear this song
in my head whenever I see two
lovers sharing a moment
together.
--------------------
This invigorating music fills me
with courage.
[NEWPAGE]
Perhaps it's true that a
person's true strength reveals
itself while protecting the
things they love most.
--------------------
A battle with a great
adversary…
[NEWPAGE]
Suddenly hearing this music
during a decisive situation
would definitely give me a
confidence boost!
--------------------
An omen that something
terrible will happen…
[NEWPAGE]
This music captures the sense
of uncertainty you'd feel if the
world you knew suddenly
ceased to exist.
--------------------
This melody conveys the
feelings of unease and hope
that come with a journey of
self-discovery.
[NEWPAGE]
With that in mind, this music
certainly suits the start of a
certain young woman's
journey.…
--------------------
This music tells the tale of two
people, bound by the fate of
royal succession that ultimately
rests on a single coin flip.
--------------------
Chocobo-choco-choco
Cho-cobo~♪ [LONGPAUSE]
Come on! All together now!
--------------------
This music captures the feeling
of saying goodbye to a loved
one for the last time.
[NEWPAGE]
But even afterward, that
feeling will undoubtedly remain
deep within, never to
disappear.
--------------------
The slum city of Zozo is
teeming with liars.
[NEWPAGE]
Apparently this type of music
can sometimes be heard when
it rains there.
--------------------
This fun, rhythmic tune almost
makes you want to drop
everything and start dancing
wherever you are.
--------------------
Oh, this is the prelude to the
opera, "Maria and Draco".
[NEWPAGE]
The two lovers get separated
by the war. I wonder what will
become of them…
--------------------
"I am thankful, my beloved, for
[SPACE_07]your tenderness and grace.
[NEWPAGE]
[SPACE_07]I see in your eyes, so gentle
[SPACE_07]and wise, all doubts and fears
[SPACE_07]erased."
[NEWPAGE]
This is the beautiful song in
which Maria shares her feelings
for Draco.
--------------------
This music plays when Ralse
and Draco confront each other.
Just how will their duel end…?
--------------------
All's well that ends well, I
guess? In opera, like in life,
there's no telling what can
happen.
--------------------
This delightful tune conveys the
lifestyle of a gambler who lives
as freely as a great airship
soaring through the skies.
--------------------
Ah, a standard jazz number.
It's not good, though. It's bad.
Literally. It's in the title.
--------------------
This intimidating piece of music
evokes the image of an
enormous, terrifying empire.
[NEWPAGE]
But, as they say, pride comes
before the fall…
--------------------
This music is as industrial as it
gets. What in the world could
they be making in this factory?
--------------------
Surely everyone wishes they
could fly through the sky at
one point or another.
[NEWPAGE]
If it WERE possible for us to
fly, I could see myself
humming this tune in the air all
the time.
--------------------
This comical melody leaves one
wondering what the heck is
going on.
--------------------
I've heard that the moogles
love to sing and dance. If that's
true, I bet they'd dance to this
music too.
--------------------
Thamasa Village is home to the
ancient magis' descendants.
[NEWPAGE]
For them, supernatural abilities
probably seem normal-natural.
--------------------
Just like music, art is imbued
with the thoughts and feelings
of its creator.
[NEWPAGE]
And, just as skilled musicians
bring music to life, there are
surely pictomancers out there
who can bring art to life too.
--------------------
I've heard that this music was
first created in the Esper
Realm. It's a truly mysterious
and magical melody, indeed.
--------------------
Some claim that the magical
Floating Continent is, in fact,
the entrance to the afterlife.
[NEWPAGE]
If so, then I imagine it's as
terrifying a place as this
dreadful music suggests.
--------------------
What's going to happen now?
Is it even possible to move on
from everything that's
transpired?
[NEWPAGE]
I believe that this music
perfectly captures those
feelings of fear and
uncertainty for the future.
--------------------
The music of an inescapable
battle…
[NEWPAGE]
If I ever found myself in such
a situation, I imagine this is
what would be playing in my
mind the whole time.
--------------------
"I may have been defeated,
[SPACE_07]but so what?"
[NEWPAGE]
Defeat is simply the seed of
victory. Even warriors need
rest, along with the patience
to let that seed grow.
--------------------
The world has been destroyed.
The cry of the ruined land
carries on the wind, and strikes
the hearts of all who hear it.
--------------------
Whoever wrote this must've
been reflecting on times long
past, when children's laughter
echoed through the streets.
--------------------
What is your personal definition
of a friend?
[NEWPAGE]
If you define it as someone you
never want to lose, then keep
this music close to your heart.
--------------------
Apparently, there is someone
who claims to be a "mimic".
They live to copy other people…
or something like that. I dunno.
[NEWPAGE]
But If I ever met such a
person, I'd want to hear them
sing with their own true voice,
without copying anyone.
--------------------
Even after you lose something
important, it still lives on inside
you as a memory.
[NEWPAGE]
This music reminds the listener
of those important things they
may have lost, and invites them
to revisit those memories.
--------------------
The art collector Owzer lives in
the upper-class, aristocratic
city of Jidoor.
[NEWPAGE]
It seems that this piece of
music comes from his personal
record collection.
--------------------
Deep within the snowy caves of
Narshe lives a yeti. This
powerful music suits him so
very perfectly.
--------------------
Apparently this is a song of
praise for the god of ruin and
destruction.
[NEWPAGE]
I wonder what the believers
expect to come from their
faith for their deity…
--------------------
It's said that this music can be
heard coming from that twisted
tower made of scattered
debris.
[NEWPAGE]
Old stories say that people
once built a tower high enough
to reach the gods, only to be
punished with destruction.
[NEWPAGE]
If that's true, then what will
become of this portentous
tower?
--------------------
[CENTER]When the harbinger cometh
[CENTER]the god of ruin shall descend
[CENTER]Wrapped in his wings of chaos
[CENTER]all will come to an end
[NEWPAGE]
This is apparently an old song
about a god of calamity.
[NEWPAGE]
Ruin and rebirth are two sides
of the same coin. Should the
god of ruin expire, something
miraculous is sure to occur.
--------------------
With the god of ruin defeated,
life and color return to the
ravaged land…
[NEWPAGE]
This wondrous medley finely
decorates the story's finale.
--------------------
Apparently this is the prelude
to a musical suite known as
"Vinyl Fallacy"… or something
like that. [LONGPAUSE]I might be wrong.
[NEWPAGE]
At any rate, this music is
probably what started it all.
--------------------
Undoubtedly, there are as many
worlds out there as there are
musical compositions.

Why, simply select "Sound" in

--------------------
Draco: There was one

largely ad-libbed. The audience
absolutely loved it, as I recall.
--------------------
Ralse: Just when we were
about to be booed off stage,
the finest actor of our time
swooped in to save the day!
[NEWPAGE]
His name? [LONGPAUSE]Why, Ultros, of
course! [LONGPAUSE]He's a superstar in the
making, without a doubt! [LONGPAUSE]
Well, maybe a little doubt.

A dragon once rushed up onto

just wanted to be an actor.

Ever heard of adamantite? It's
a mineral that only comes from
the innards of a monster called
the Adamantoise.
[NEWPAGE]
If you ever come across any, I

[NEWPAGE]
Stories say that the

adamantite? People call it
"trapezohedron".

If we had some, I reckon I
could make a sword even
better than that Ragnarok

--------------------
We'll need us the fang of a

[NEWPAGE]
I've heard old stories about one

the Esper Realm.
--------------------
Oh, you have all the materials… [LONGPAUSE]
With these, I can make the

[CENTER]Blood Sword
[CENTER]FINAL FANTASY II
[NEWPAGE]
This sword's curse drains an
enemy's life energy and gives
it to its wielder. Its blade is
always a dark crimson color.
[NEWPAGE]
The Blood Sword appears
throughout the series, but it is
a particularly fierce weapon in
Final Fantasy II.
[NEWPAGE]
Because the sword deals
percentage-based damage, it
can even take down bosses
surprisingly quickly.
[NEWPAGE]
In the Japanese version of
Dissidia, Firion shouts "Blood
weapon equipped!" when
activating EX Mode.
[NEWPAGE]
Said weapon is a reference to

[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Crystals
[CENTER]FINAL FANTASY IX
[NEWPAGE]
A crystal in each planet's core
produces souls for life forms,
and recalls those souls when
life forms die.
[NEWPAGE]
When souls return to the
crystal, the crystal stores their
memories.
[NEWPAGE]
This allows the crystal to grow,
which in turn allows life on the
host planet to flourish.
[NEWPAGE]
When this soul circulation ends,
the crystal will stop growing,
all activity on the planet will
cease.
[NEWPAGE]
Eventually, the crystal will
return to the cosmos.
[NEWPAGE]
Espers are actually the tangible
embodiments of a crystal's
stored life memories.

[NEWPAGE]
Pyreflies are also responsible
forgiving monsters in Spira
their temporary physical
forms.
[NEWPAGE]
This is why monsters burst into
pyreflies when defeated.
[NEWPAGE]
Between Djose Temple and
Guadosalam lies a massive

[NEWPAGE]
Games take place inside a giant
sphere of water suspended in
the air by pyreflies.
[NEWPAGE]
The Temples of Yevon officially
endorse blitzball, as it's helpful
in banishing thoughts about Sin
from the people's minds.
[NEWPAGE]
In the game, Tidus can recruit a
variety of blitzball players,
including two men with familiar

[CHOICE] Let's chat a bit
--------------------
Here are all the available jobs
at the moment.
[NEWPAGE]
[CHOICE] Super Doctor D
[CHOICE] EXIT
--------------------
Know that really tall building in
town? A doctor lives there,
believe it or not. He seems to
need help with something.
[NEWPAGE]
You should pay him a visit. I bet
it'll be a hoot! [LONGPAUSE]Maybe.
--------------------
The doc's in the tallest building
in town.
--------------------
Visitors on such a fine, clear
day! What a rare surprise,
indeed!
--------------------
You're looking for a doctor?
Ha, get real! Ain't no doctors
here! Now scram!
[NEWPAGE]
"Wait, if he's lying, then…"
"Dadaluma is the doctor!?"
"Urgh, this is so confusing…"
[NEWPAGE]
There are as many doctors in
Zozo as there are thieves in a
slum.
[NEWPAGE]
Everyone here is a doctor, in
fact. Everyone except me.
[NEWPAGE]
Also, no one ever gets hurt or
sick here, so the doctor
business is as good as dead!
[NEWPAGE]
And since there are no clients
at all, I have zero motivation to
test my new medical
treatments.
[NEWPAGE]
"So, what you're saying is…"
"You're so busy with patients…"
"That you need someone to help
[SPACE_07]test your new treatments?"
[NEWPAGE]
Oh, and just so you know, you
won't get anything in return if
you agree to be test subjects. [LONGPAUSE]
So take my advice and get lost!
[NEWPAGE]
Accept Dadaluma's request?
[CHOICE] Accept request
[CHOICE] EXIT
--------------------
First, let's try something
non-poisonous. Go get a
status ailment. Any ailment
will do, except for poison.
--------------------
You're not about to agree to
test my new treatment, I
hope? That'd be stupid!
[NEWPAGE]
Accept Dadaluma's request?
[CHOICE] Accept request
[CHOICE] EXIT
--------------------
Ah, you have a non-poison
status ailment. Excellent.
Then I'll try out this spell I just
learned.
--------------------
Basuna!
--------------------
Hmm. That didn't work at all.
This isn't compensation, so
don't come back anymore.
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained 10 Cure-Alls!
--------------------
Next, let's try treating ailments
that make the body soft.
Go get a soft, squishy body,
then come see me again.
--------------------
Okay, let's get started.
I have a new spell this time,
too.
--------------------
Stona!
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Katyusha!
--------------------
Next, let's try treating ailments
that help your eyes. Go get
really good eyesight and then
come see me again.
--------------------
I'm all set here. I sure hope my
treatment works this time…
--------------------
Blindna!
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Barrette!
--------------------
Okay, this is the last one. It's a
lot simpler than the other ones,
too.
[NEWPAGE]
Get nice and lively. The more
liveliness, the better. And
definitely don't have green
skin.
--------------------
Oh, you make quite the zombie!
Once I cure this, my work will
be complete. Here goes!
--------------------
Cursna!
--------------------
Nice. Every treatment was a
failure. Thanks for nothing.
[NEWPAGE]
This isn't your reward.
Also, you can stop coming back.
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Ribbon!
--------------------
I know it's a nice, sunny day
out and all, but there's nothing
I can do for you.
--------------------
There's nothing I can do for
you.
--------------------
Lone Wolf: Hmm? Haven't I seen
you somewhere before? [LONGPAUSE]
Oh, well. There's nothin' left in
this town anyways.
[NEWPAGE]
Wait… [LONGPAUSE]That ain't entirely true. [LONGPAUSE]
Most of the houses are locked
'n all, so maybe there IS some
stuff left.
[NEWPAGE]
But only a treasure hunter'd be
able to unlock 'em, I bet…
--------------------
Strange words are written on
the gravestone…
[NEWPAGE]

[CENTER]TELO MET EK ESS
[NEWPAGE]
Touching the words in the
proper order might cause
something to happen.
[NEWPAGE]
Try touching the words?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No

[CENTER]Armor of Champions:
[CENTER]Maximillian
[NEWPAGE]
Humans. Have you the mettle to
endure my might!?
--------------------
I've heard there's a forbidden
area somewhere under Lady
Ultima's tower.
[NEWPAGE]
They say it houses equipment
so powerful that it had to be
sealed away.
--------------------
Shall I magically warp you back
to the Lost Path's entrance?
[CHOICE] Yes, please!
[CHOICE] No, thank you
--------------------
Very well. I do hope you'll
come and see us again
sometime.
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Floral Fallal!

There's a music box here.
--------------------
[RELM]: ?? [LONGPAUSE]
What is this thing?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Oh, that's… [LONGPAUSE]
Hrmm. I suppose the time has
finally come…
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: ?? [LONGPAUSE]What do you
mean?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Well, you see,
[RELM]. This is actually your
mother's music box.
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: It's Mommy's…?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Yes. She asked me
to give it to you when you got
older.
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: … … [LONGPAUSE]
Can I open it?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: !! [LONGPAUSE]
What's going on!?
What's wrong!?
--------------------
Clyde: … Baram… [LONGPAUSE]
Forgive… me…
--------------------
Wife: You're having another
nightmare, dear…
--------------------
Clyde: … [LONGPAUSE]I'm… [LONGPAUSE]sorr… y…
--------------------
Wife: Do you really have to go?
There's no other way?
--------------------
Clyde: … [LONGPAUSE]
I can't stay here. I can't let the
ghosts of my old life hurt you
or our daughter.
--------------------
Wife: … I don't know what you
did in the past. But [RELM]
and I will always be there for
you.
[NEWPAGE]
Never forget that. That's all I
ask.
--------------------
Clyde: … [LONGPAUSE]
Yeah. You've done so much for
me. Thank you.
--------------------
Wife: I haven't much time
left… [LONGPAUSE]
[NEWPAGE]
Wife: [STRAGO]. Lara.
Please take good care of
[RELM] for me after I'm
gone.
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Don't be
ridiculous! Stay strong and
pull yourself together!
[NEWPAGE]
Lara: I agree! Quit feeling
sorry for yourself and get it
together! Unless you want a
taste of my Geomancy!
[NEWPAGE]
Wife: Heh… No, thanks. [LONGPAUSE]
I wouldn't last one second
against your magic.
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Now listen here.
Quit worrying. Just focus on
getting back on your feet.
[NEWPAGE]
Wife: Auntie… [LONGPAUSE]
Uncle… [LONGPAUSE]Thank you.
--------------------
Wife: … [LONGPAUSE][RELM]. [LONGPAUSE]
Please forgive me for leaving
you so soon.
[NEWPAGE]
I'll instill this music box with
my magic. When the time is
right and you're a little older,
I hope you'll open it.
[NEWPAGE]
… … [LONGPAUSE]
I love you, [LONGPAUSE][RELM]. [LONGPAUSE]
From the very bottom of my
heart.
--------------------
[RELM]: Where did… [LONGPAUSE]
Where did Daddy go?
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: Why are my
mommy and daddy gone…?
--------------------
[RELM]: … … [LONGPAUSE]Grandpa.
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Oh, thank goodness!
I was so worried! You opened
the box, and then fainted all of
a sudden!
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: I had a dream
about Mommy. In the dream,
I was still a baby.
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: … … [LONGPAUSE]It must've
been her magic. Your mother
cast a spell on this magic box
long ago.
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: Mommy… [LONGPAUSE]
Thank you.
--------------------
[RELM]: Huh? There's
something inside the music
box…

a curse. No matter what

that.

You are this world's last ray of
light… our final hope.

A Magitek knight forged by the
Empire and tempered in battle.
No one truly knows the woman

their commander, they should
break rank and withdraw.
--------------------
[CYAN]: We must warn the
king!
--------------------
Doman Sentry: To the king, with
all haste!
--------------------
[CYAN]: That is not true!
King: I worry for your family… [LONGPAUSE]
Unngh… [LONGPAUSE]Difficult to breathe… [LONGPAUSE]
Chest burning…

[CHOICE] About the Floating Continent
[CHOICE] About Narshe's surroundings
[CHOICE] Never mind
--------------------
Banon: When the world was
torn apart, the Floating
Continent fell from the sky.
[NEWPAGE]
Yet, there are new reports
that the continent has taken to
the sky again. I can only
assume it's Kefka's doing.
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: There have also been
rumors of a mysterious tower
that suddenly appeared north
of the Veldt.
[NEWPAGE]
I wonder if the two events are
connected…
--------------------
Banon: There's an old man who
lives north of Narshe, near the
sea. It sounds like he's a hermit
who lives in seclusion.
[NEWPAGE]
Even so, maybe you should visit
him if you get the chance.
