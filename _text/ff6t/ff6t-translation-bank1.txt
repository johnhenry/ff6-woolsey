there a thousand years after
the War of the Magi… [WAIT_18][SHORTPAUSE]

Biggs: Bah! Probably just
another wild goose chase… [WAIT_18][SHORTPAUSE]
[NEWPAGE]
Wedge: I don't know… [WAIT_18][SHORTPAUSE]
[NEWPAGE]
They wouldn't have let us use
her unless they were confident

Biggs: Ah, yes… our witch.[WAIT_18][SHORTPAUSE]

I hear she fried fifty of our

[NEWPAGE]
Do you want to learn about
save points?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
Wedge: The girl takes point.
And don't waste time on the
riffraff! Remember what
we're here for. Let's move!
--------------------
Wedge: The esper's gotta be
here. Let's keep looking!
--------------------
Narshe Guard: Imperial Magitek
armor!? Not even Narshe is
safe anymore!
--------------------
Narshe Guard: The Empire's got
no business here!
--------------------
Narshe Guard: For Narshe!
--------------------
Wedge: According to our source,
they unearthed the frozen
esper in a new mine shaft they
were digging…
[NEWPAGE]
This must be it.
--------------------
Biggs: I'll handle this.
Stand back!
--------------------
Narshe Guard: We've got 'em
trapped now!
--------------------
Narshe Guard: Defend the
mines!
--------------------
It's locked.
--------------------
Girl: Where… am I?
--------------------
Old Man: My, my! And I just
removed the crown!
[NEWPAGE]
Girl: My head… hurts…
--------------------
Old Man: Easy, there!
This is a slave crown.
The others were using it to
control you.
[NEWPAGE]
It was robbing you of your
thoughts, making it so you'd do
whatever they told you.
--------------------
Girl: I can't remember a thing…
[NEWPAGE]
Old Man: Don't worry.
It'll all come back to you… [LONGPAUSE]
In time, that is.
[NEWPAGE]
Girl: …
--------------------
Girl: My name is… [TERRA]…
[NEWPAGE]
Old Man: Impressive! I've never
heard of anyone recovering so
fast. You must be made of
tougher stuff than most…
--------------------
Narshe Guard: Open up! We're
here for the Magitek armor
pilot!
--------------------
Narshe Guard: Open this door
right now, and hand over that
girl! She's an agent of the
Empire!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Empire…?
Magitek armor…?
--------------------
Old Man: There's no time to
explain! You need to get out of
here! These fools aren't going
to listen to reason…
--------------------
Old Man: This way! Quickly!
--------------------
A mysterious young woman,
born with the gift of magic,
and enslaved by the Gestahlian
Empire…
--------------------
Please enter a name.
--------------------
Old Man: Make your way out of
town through the mines! I'll try
to buy you some time.
--------------------
Narshe Guard: There she is!
--------------------
Narshe Guard: Up there!
--------------------
Kefka: My sweet little magic
user… Uwee-hee-hee!
[NEWPAGE]
With this slave crown, you'll be
all mine!
--------------------
[TERRA]: No! Get away from
me!
--------------------
Gestahl: Soldiers of the Empire!
We stand at the dawn of a new
age!
[NEWPAGE]
Gestahl: The lost power of
magic has returned to us!
We are the chosen ones!
--------------------
Cid: This is my finest creation…
Magic and technology joined as
one… The ultimate machine!
--------------------
Gestahl: The time has come for
us to claim our rightful
dominion over the world!
[NEWPAGE]
Gestahl: Nothing shall stand in
our way!
[NEWPAGE]
"Hurrah!"
"Long live Emperor Gestahl!"
--------------------
Old Man: Took you long enough!
Busy with all the robbing and
plundering, I presume?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I prefer the term
"treasure hunting"!
[NEWPAGE]
Old Man: Ha! Semantic nonsense!
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: There's a huge
difference!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Anyway, is there
something you need me to do?
[NEWPAGE]
Old Man: There is indeed.
…I met the girl.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: …!?
You don't mean…?
--------------------
Old Man: The city guard is
pursuing her as we speak.
[NEWPAGE]
This city has the strength to
stand up to the Empire, but it
won't use it…
[NEWPAGE]
The people are just too
stubbornly independent to join
an underground resistance
group like the Returners.
[NEWPAGE]
I tried to explain that the
Empire was controlling the girl,
but they wouldn't even listen…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: All right…
So, you want me to get her out
of Narshe?
--------------------
Old Man: That would be the
idea. Make your way to Figaro
for the time being…
--------------------
A treasure hunter and
trail-worn traveler, searching
the world over for relics of the
past…
--------------------
Narshe Guard: Now we've got
her!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Wonderful…
There's a whole bunch of 'em…
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Kupo…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Moogles…
Are you saying you want to
help?
--------------------
Kupo!!!
--------------------
Moogle: Use us to protect
[TERRA] from the guards!
[NEWPAGE]
Would you like an explanation?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
You'll fight using 3 different
groups. Press the Y Button to
switch between them.
[NEWPAGE]
Defeat the leader of the guards
before his men reach
[TERRA], or the battle's lost!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Uhhhn…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Thanks, moogles!
We're in your debt!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: This switch oughta…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Eh? You back with
us now?
--------------------
[TERRA]: You… saved me?
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Save your thanks
for the moogles!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Ugh… I can't
remember a thing… It's like my
mind's trapped in a fog…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: You lost your
memory!?
--------------------
[TERRA]: A man said it would
come back… eventually…
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: So, you've got
amnesia…
[NEWPAGE]
Don't worry! I won't leave your
side until your memory returns!
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: …?
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: I'm not gonna up
and abandon someone just
because they lost their
memory!
[NEWPAGE]
I'll keep you safe! I promise!
--------------------
King: You mean, this young
woman is…?
--------------------
[TERRA]: Who are you?
--------------------
King: Oh… my apologies!
--------------------
King: How rude of me to turn
my back to a lady on our very
first meeting!
--------------------
The young king of Figaro Castle,
Imperial ally, and champion of
the technological revolution…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: I am [EDGAR],
the king of Figaro.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Heh… Surprised that
someone like me knows a king?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Well, I'll catch you
two later!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: So, you're an
Imperial soldier, right?
Don't worry. Figaro and the
Empire are allies.
[NEWPAGE]
Feel free to rest here for as
long as you'd like. It's not in my
blood to harm a lady!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Why are you being
so kind to me? Is it because of
my… abilities?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: I'll give you three
reasons. First of all, your
beauty has captivated me!
[NEWPAGE]
Second… I'm dying to know if
I'm your type!
--------------------
I guess your… abilities… would
rank a distant third.
--------------------
[TERRA]: …? [LONGPAUSE]
What's the matter?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Guess my
technique's getting a bit rusty…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Come find me again
once you've had a chance to
rest.
--------------------
[TERRA]: Hmm… I suppose a
normal girl would have felt
something from those words.
[NEWPAGE]
But… not me…
--------------------
Feel free to wander about the
castle.
--------------------
Go and speak to the king.
--------------------
The advanced weapons and
other items we manufacture
here are shipped to South
Figaro.
--------------------
The ancients once wielded a
force known as "magic".
Those who mastered the art
were called "magi".
--------------------
Scholars all over the world are
studying magic. But you can
only learn so much about
something without seeing it…
--------------------
To think that a
thousand-year-old city
would be lying buried beneath
the sands of this very desert!
[NEWPAGE]
I found a short passage about
the city in an ancient text, but I
haven't been able to make
much sense of it.
[NEWPAGE]
"Five steps from where the
[SPACE_07]queen stands…"
--------------------
I heard the Gestahlian Empire
got its hands on something
called "magic"…
--------------------
The Gestahlian Empire has
already overthrown all three of
the other nations on the
southern continent.
[NEWPAGE]
It's only a matter of time
before they make their way up
here…
--------------------
Now that Gestahl has the power
of Magitek at his command, he's
set his sights on world
domination.
--------------------
Our king showers his attention
on women. Young, old, pretty,
or plain… No one is safe!
--------------------
His Highness said he'd marry me
when I got old enough!
--------------------
King [EDGAR], how long do
you 'spect me to keep waiting
for you to propose? Sheesh!
--------------------
Not too long ago, the king tried
to hit on the high priestess.
Oh, did she ever let him have it!
[NEWPAGE]
I'm sure he's made a pass or
two at you already, hasn't he?
--------------------
[TERRA]: …
--------------------
Oh! King [EDGAR]!
--------------------
…
--------------------
you must be one Lete
son of a submariner
to have found this
--------------------
These good-for-nothing
brigands have been locked up
for thievery… and worse!
You'd best keep your distance.
--------------------
I demand to see [EDGAR]!
How dare they keep us in this
stinking pit!
--------------------
Ugh, something smells terrible
in here! [LONGPAUSE]
…Oh! I think it's me!
--------------------
Relax, my boys are just blowing
off some steam. I'm sure King
[EDGAR] will let us out of
here in no time.
[NEWPAGE]
We're just small potatoes
compared to the real threat
lurking out there.
King [EDGAR] knows that.
--------------------
I'm Lone Wolf the pickpocket!
--------------------
High Priestess: [EDGAR] is
simply unbelievable! First the
nurse, now me! The man hits on
anything that moves!
--------------------
High Priestess: [EDGAR] has a
twin brother, you know. He was
such a nice boy, always thinking
of his family…
--------------------
Youth: [EDGAR], what's
wrong with Dad? Why's
everyone talking about a
successor?
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: Are you blind?
Haven't you seen how thin his
face has become?
--------------------
Youth: …?
…What do you mean?
--------------------
Youth: [EDGAR]!
--------------------
Youth: Are you… crying?
--------------------
[EDGAR]'s twin brother,
who traded the throne
for his own freedom…
--------------------
High Priestess: Ah, yes…
[SABIN]. I'm sure he's a fine
young man by now.
[NEWPAGE]
He was just a boy when he left.
Even smaller than his brother.
I often wonder where he is
now, and what he's doing…
--------------------
Chancellor: The king's brother
was so disgusted by the
succession that he fled the
castle, never looking back.
[NEWPAGE]
I've heard tell that the entire
matter was settled by the flip
of a coin…
--------------------
Merchant: I can't take money
from the king!
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: You have a family,
don't you? Just be quiet and
take it.
--------------------
Merchant: Sir [SABIN], I
couldn't possibly accept your
money!
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: You can and you
will!
[NEWPAGE]
I'll never hear the end of it
from [EDGAR] if I run around
acting like I own the place!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: I hear you've been
busy down south, taking over a
country or three!
[NEWPAGE]
Just what is the Empire up to?
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: That's none of your
concern.
--------------------
Sir Kefka!? What in the world
brings you--
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: Out of my way!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Well?
How do you like my castle?
--------------------
King [EDGAR]! There's
someone from the Empire here
to see you, sire!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Kefka, no doubt!
--------------------
Kefka: Phooey! Emperor
Gestahl's stupid orders!
--------------------
Kefka: [EDGAR], you pinhead!
Why do you have to live out in
the middle of a stinking desert?
[NEWPAGE]
These recon jobs are the pits!
--------------------
Kefka: Ahem! There's SAND on
my boots!
--------------------
Soldiers: All gone, sir!
--------------------
Kefka: How pathetic!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: You wouldn't be
thinking of invading my
kingdom next, would you?
[NEWPAGE]
We have an alliance…
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: An alliance? With this
miserable little sandpit? Don't
make me laugh!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: What brings
Emperor Gestahl's own court
mage, Kefka, to my humble
castle?
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: A girl of no importance
recently escaped from us. We
heard she found refuge here.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: This wouldn't have
to do with that "witch"
everyone's been whispering
about, would it?
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: Lies! She merely stole
something of minor value. Is
she here?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: That's a tough one…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: There are more
girls in here than grains of
sand in the desert.
[NEWPAGE]
A man couldn't possibly keep
track of them all!
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: Oh, [EDGAR]…
You know you only stand to
lose by trying to hide her from
us!
[NEWPAGE]
Hee-hee-hee…
--------------------
Kefka: I truly hope nothing
happens to your precious
Figaro!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I didn't like the
sound of that…
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: So, where DID
[TERRA] go, anyway?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Take her to her
room…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: I'd love to stay and
chat, but the chancellor and I
need to do some planning now.
[NEWPAGE]
Being a king's not all tea and
crumpets. If you'll excuse me…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Follow me.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Sorry, I didn't mean
to drag you around like this
without giving you a chance to
rest. I'm--
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: [LOCKE], right?
…[EDGAR] told me about you.
Is it true you're a thief?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I'm a TREASURE
HUNTER!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: On the surface,
[EDGAR] pretends to support
the Empire.
[NEWPAGE]
Truth is, he's collaborating with
an underground resistance
group called the Returners.
[NEWPAGE]
I serve as their go-between.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: The old man you
met in Narshe is one of us, too.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: The Empire…
But, I'm an Imperial soldier…!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Not anymore.
They were using you. That's all!
Things are different now.
--------------------
[TERRA]: It's just… I don't
know what I should do.
[NEWPAGE]
Whenever I try to think, it just
makes my head hurt even
worse…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: All that matters is
that you make your own
decisions from now on.
[NEWPAGE]
You don't have to think too
hard right now. You'll know
what you want to do when the
time comes.
--------------------
[TERRA]: But how will I know
which choice is right…?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: …?
[NEWPAGE]
What in the--
--------------------
[EDGAR]: What's going on?
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: It's the Empire!
Kefka, he--
--------------------
[EDGAR]: What do you think
you're doing!?
--------------------
Kefka: Bring me the girl. Now!
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: I have no idea what
you're talking about!
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: Oh? Then… enjoy the
barbecue! Hee-hee-hee!
--------------------
The castle's on fire!
--------------------
Fire! Fire! Heh-heh-heh…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Get her ready…
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: Yes, sire!
--------------------
Kefka: Had a change of heart?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: It seems I have no
choice…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: …Or perhaps I do!
--------------------
Kefka: Oh, my! The brave and
noble king abandons his people
to save his own skin!
[NEWPAGE]
How utterly delightful!
Hee-hee-hee!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Jump! [PAUSE_02][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Yahoo!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: All right! Sink her
into the sand!
--------------------
Soldier: Figaro Dive Mode
engaged! [PAUSE_02][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
Chancellor: Witness the glory of
Figaro!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Bravo, Figaro! [PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
Kefka: Go! KILL THEM!!!
--------------------
Kefka: Son of a sandworm!
You'll pay for this!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: That was great! [PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[TERRA]: Were those bad
people? I… [LONGPAUSE]I'm scared…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: [TERRA], there's
someone we'd like you to
meet…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Like I told you
before, we're members of the
Returners…
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: Would you be
willing to meet our leader?
[NEWPAGE]
Magic is going to be the key to
winning this war.
--------------------
[TERRA]: Magic…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: That esper reacted
to your magical powers.
There's got to be a connection…
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: I don't know any
more than you do. These
powers just come naturally to
me.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: But no human is
born with the powers you have!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Forgive me.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: …What should I do?
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: The Empire will be
coming after us. They want
your powers for their own.
[NEWPAGE]
And if they get them, the world
is done for…
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA], you want to
understand your own powers,
don't you?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Then I think you
should meet with Banon.
[NEWPAGE]
He may be able to help you find
out more about why you have
them.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: …
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Please…
[EDGAR]'s right.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: There's a cave just
south of here that leads to
South Figaro…
[NEWPAGE]
Let's head in that direction.
--------------------
This cave leads to South Figaro.
I'm afraid I can't let you
through, though.
--------------------
Soldier: King [EDGAR]!
Where are you headed, sire?
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: Through the cave,
and eastward to South Figaro.
[NEWPAGE]
We'll then make for the
Returner headquarters in the
north.
[NEWPAGE]
Return to the castle and pass
the word along.
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: Understood, sire!
Take care!
--------------------
Zzz… zzz…
--------------------
There's a clock key in his
pocket…
[CHOICE] (Take it)
[CHOICE] (Stealing is wrong!)
--------------------
[CHOICE] (Wind the clock)
[CHOICE] (Leave it)
--------------------
An old clock…
It's not ticking.
--------------------
An old clock…
It's ticking.
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Clock Key!
--------------------
Welcome to South Figaro!
--------------------
Our shops carry weapons,
armor, and relics of the utmost
quality!
--------------------
Did you see how cool Figaro
Castle looked as it moved along
through the sand?
[NEWPAGE]
…No? Well, I suppose that
would have been kind of hard,
what with it being underground
and all…
--------------------
Head east and you'll see
Mt. Kolts.
--------------------
Beyond Mt. Kolts lie the Sabre
Mountains.
--------------------
You can gain all kinds of
abilities by equipping relics.
[NEWPAGE]
These shoes double my walking
speed!
--------------------
My husband, Duncan, is a
martial artist. He's famous
even in Figaro, to the north.
[NEWPAGE]
He took his students to
Mt. Kolts for some meditation
and training, so he probably
won't be back for a while.
--------------------
Duncan's Wife: [SABIN],
where are Vargas and Duncan?
--------------------
[SABIN]: Vargas… turned on
our master… Vargas, he…
--------------------
Duncan's Wife: Oh, Vargas…
Why would you do such a thing?
[NEWPAGE]
But my husband was able to
pass his techniques along to
you, [SABIN]… I'm sure he'd
have no regrets.
--------------------
[SABIN]: For the past ten
years you've treated me like a
son.
[NEWPAGE]
I'll never forget all the things
you've done for me!
--------------------
…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Right, ignore us and
maybe we'll just disappear…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Back off,
[LOCKE]. That guy looks
familiar… [LONGPAUSE]
Yeah, that's him, all right…
--------------------
He comes and goes like the
wind, swearing allegiance to no
one. Behind his wintry gaze lies
a face known to no one alive…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: That's [SHADOW]…
He's an assassin. He'd kill his
own best friend for the right
price…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Guess we'd better
steer clear of him.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Leave us. The dog
eats strangers…
--------------------
That man at the counter's got a
nasty look about him…
--------------------
That man at the counter…
…Hey! Where'd he go!?
--------------------
You look just like that student
of Duncan's.
--------------------
I heard about Duncan… It's
unfortunate.
--------------------
Duncan's been training his boy,
Vargas, along with his other
students.
[NEWPAGE]
He's always grumbling about
how the kid never seems to be
making any progress.
--------------------
The big house at the north end
of town belongs to the richest
family here.
--------------------
I hear the Empire's been
invading one town after
another. I wonder how safe
we are in South Figaro…
--------------------
Figaro Castle stood up to the
Empire?
[NEWPAGE]
Great, now we'll all be drawn
into this!
--------------------
What kind of dummies would
go and make the Empire mad?
--------------------
This town's defenses are tight.
Even with their Magitek armor,
the Imperials won't find it easy
to get inside.
--------------------
"The city's eastern border…
[SPACE_07]Invading from there would…"
[NEWPAGE]
…!?
[NEWPAGE]
H-hey! Wh-what do you think
you're doing!? Barging in here
when I'm trying to write a
letter! Hmph!
--------------------
Oh, uh, sorry… I may be the
richest man in town, but even
that doesn't keep me from
being startled!
--------------------
Oh, what have I done?
I betrayed my town to the
Empire! All I could think of was
the money…
--------------------
Clang, clang…
Clang, clang…
I'm Magitek armor!
--------------------
My dad's super-important, so
important people come here
for dinner all the time!
Even General Le--
[NEWPAGE]
I mean, um… general-ly… [LONGPAUSE]
Uh, I forgot what I was going
to say!
--------------------
Wind the clock…
Wind the clock…
[NEWPAGE]
Uh, that was just a jump-rope
rhyme!
--------------------
I wonder if it'll really come to

home now, before it's too late…
--------------------
The Imperial troops have
turned this house into their
headquarters.
--------------------
There's always a nasty draft in
this room. Oh, where is it
coming from? I'm afraid I'll
catch a cold!
--------------------
I don't like strangers. Bring me
some wine and maybe I'll talk
to you.
--------------------
No wine? Then what are you
doing here?
--------------------
Hmph… Cur!
--------------------
Ah, wine! *glug, glug*
[NEWPAGE]
Hmm? Secret passage? Well,
yes, there is a tunnel from
here to the mansion on the
north end of town…
--------------------
Go downstairs and tell my
grandson the password. It's,
uh… ummm… I forget!
--------------------
My grandpa used to be a
servant for the richest family
in town.
--------------------
But he said I'm only supposed
to let merchants through here
now.
--------------------
You're a merchant, right?
Okay, go ahead.
--------------------
The password is…
[CHOICE] "Rosebud"
[CHOICE] "Courage"
[CHOICE] "Failure"
--------------------
Can't fool me! I know you're an
Imperial spy!
--------------------
I'll show you the secret
entrance.
--------------------
Cool, huh?
--------------------
Outta my way! I've gotta get
this wine over to the
old-timer! 'Cause, see, some of
us have jobs!
[NEWPAGE]
Now scram!
--------------------
My work here is done! You're in

Okay, okay, fine…

[EDGAR]: Hmm…?
What's that smell…?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: These flowers…
He always liked these…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: This tea…
It was his favorite.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: These dishes…
They're just like the ones he
always used!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Could [SABIN] be
living here…?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Hey…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Do you happen to
know where I could find the
man who lives here?
--------------------
Man: Sure do! Left a couple of
days ago, soon as he heard
Master Duncan had been killed.
Headed up into the mountains!
[NEWPAGE]
They say Duncan's son Vargas is
missing, too… I don't like it one
bit!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: So, [SABIN]
became a student of Duncan's…
[NEWPAGE]
All this time, he's been under
the wing of such a great
teacher…
--------------------
You! You're Returners!
--------------------
[SABIN]…?
--------------------
Vargas: [SABIN] sent you,
didn't he?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Who're you?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: You were the one
sneaking around us the whole
way up here, weren't you?
[NEWPAGE]
Vargas: And if I was?
--------------------
[TERRA]: It was you, wasn't
it? The disciple who murdered
Master Duncan.
--------------------
Vargas: Hmph. Well, it doesn't
really matter who you are.
I've got no plans to surrender.
[NEWPAGE]
Woe is the day you met me…
It'll be the last day of your
lives!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: [SABIN]?
Is he here?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: [SABIN]!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Brother?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: …Brother?
You're his twin brother!?
--------------------
[TERRA]: His… brother?
At first, I thought you were
another one of Vargas's
Gorgiases…
--------------------
[SABIN]: You thought I was
a… Gorgias?
--------------------
[SABIN]: I guess I'll, uh…
take that as a compliment!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Anyway…
[EDGAR], what are you doing
here?
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: We're on our way
to the Sabre Mountains.
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: To the Returner
hideout, no doubt?
--------------------
[SABIN]: So, the wheels are
finally turning…
[NEWPAGE]
I've been watching from a
distance, hoping the world
would come to its senses.
[NEWPAGE]
The way things were going, I
was afraid Figaro would end up
as a puppet state.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: A means of striking
back has presented itself.
[NEWPAGE]
There will be no more playing
lapdog to the Empire… I'm
through with that act.
--------------------
[SABIN]: Think a "Gorgias"
like me could be of any help?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: You'd join us?
[SABIN]…!
--------------------
[SABIN]: I think Duncan
would rest easier knowing his
training helped bring peace to
the world.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Well then, let's get
going!
--------------------
King [EDGAR]! This way,
please!
--------------------
Have you spoken with Banon?
--------------------
The Empire wouldn't even think
of looking for our headquarters
here.
--------------------
Aha!

Welcome!

Thank you!

The one to whom the esper
responded.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: Esper…?
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: It seems the Empire
had complete control over her.
--------------------
Banon: Carrier pigeons have
kept me informed.
[NEWPAGE]
I also heard that she wiped out
fifty Imperial soldiers in mere
minutes…
--------------------
[TERRA]: No, that's not…!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: [TERRA]!
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: For heaven's sake,
Banon! The girl doesn't
remember anything!
--------------------
Banon: Hiding from the truth
won't change it!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Banon!
We brought her with us.
--------------------
Banon: Perhaps you've heard
this story before?
[NEWPAGE]
Once, when people were still
pure and innocent, there was a
box they were told never to
open…
[NEWPAGE]
But someone went and opened
it anyway, unleashing all the

Banon? He went outside just a

--------------------
Welcome back! Glad to see
you're okay.
--------------------
Welcome back!
--------------------
Is Banon all right?
--------------------
My wounds are healing.
--------------------
The Empire is snuffing out
Returners left and right. We
must find a way to strike back
before it's too late…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: The Empire stole
someone important from me.
I've hated it ever since…

important in my life. I have no
family… no friends…
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: That's not true!
[NEWPAGE]
And besides, I'm sure there are
people who feel you're
important to them.
[NEWPAGE]
Those people are counting on
you, too…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: It's not easy asking
so much of you…
[NEWPAGE]
And if we force our ideas on
you, we're no different from
the Empire.
[NEWPAGE]
So… we want you to decide for
yourself.
--------------------
[SABIN]: I don't know what
to tell you… But I do know that
I trust my brother completely.

He's always thought of my

I think you should trust him,

"Someone" has to sneak into

[EDGAR]: [LOCKE]!
--------------------
[SABIN]: [EDGAR]…
Old habits die hard, eh?
--------------------
Banon: What about us?
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: We can escape
down the Lethe River and make
our way to Narshe.
[NEWPAGE]
I'm curious about that esper
they found in the mines…
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: Very well. I'll ready the
raft by the back entrance.
[NEWPAGE]
It's risky, but we don't have
much of a choice at this point.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: It's not safe here.
Come with us to Narshe…
[NEWPAGE]
It could be a chance for you to
gain a better understanding of
your abilities.
--------------------
Banon: We've no time to
dilly-dally. Let's make for
Narshe!
--------------------
We'll handle things here. Please
head on to Narshe!
--------------------
We're counting on you to
protect Banon!
--------------------
The Lethe River runs through a
series of huge, underground
caverns.
--------------------
Banon: We all know that the
Gestahlian Empire is using its
Magitek power to wage war.
[NEWPAGE]
The question is, where did they
get that power?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: I had [LOCKE] dig
around for information.
[NEWPAGE]
It seems the Empire has been
gathering scholars from around
the world to study espers.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Narshe's esper was
also the reason for the
Imperial assault there.
--------------------
Banon: Well then…
--------------------
[TERRA]: Are you saying
there's some kind of connection
between espers and Magitek?
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: Espers and Magitek…
Only one possible link comes to
mind.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: You don't mean…
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: The War of the Magi.
--------------------
"No!"
"That's impossible…!"
--------------------
[LOCKE]: My grandma used to
tell me bedtime stories about
magical machines…
[NEWPAGE]
…Those stories were true?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: You're saying we're
on the verge of a second War
of the Magi?
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: It's only a guess.
[NEWPAGE]
The war took place a thousand
years ago, and every historian
has a different theory.
[NEWPAGE]
But one theory says that
energy drained from espers
was used to power machines…
[NEWPAGE]
…and that ordinary humans
were also infused with that
same energy.
--------------------
[TERRA]: So that's what
Magitek power is…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: If we're going to
fight Magitek enemies, we need
Magitek weapons of our own.
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: No! That would bring
about another War of the Magi!
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: Then what do you
propose?
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: I was wondering if we
might not be able to have a
chat with an esper…
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: …With an esper!?
--------------------
Banon: It's risky, but that esper
reacted to [TERRA] before…
[NEWPAGE]
If we could get it to react to
her again, we just might be
able to wake it up.
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: Do you really think
that would work…?
--------------------
Banon: I can't say for sure, but
I believe it's our best shot…
[NEWPAGE]
Of course, we can't do anything
without [TERRA]'s help.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: [TERRA]…
--------------------
[TERRA]: I'll do it.
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: I'm not entirely
sure I understand the plan… but
what the hey!
[NEWPAGE]
This sounds like it'll be fun!

Of course, maybe with you and

Arvis: Everyone's been a little

Banon: We believe [TERRA]
may be able to help us get
answers to our questions about
the esper.
[NEWPAGE]
Arvis: Well, the townspeople
are still quite curious about it
as well.
[NEWPAGE]
If we approach them in the
right way, there's a good
chance they'll agree to let her
see it.

[EDGAR]: That esper is either
going to save us… or dig us an

You don't happen to know how
I could get to Narshe, do you?
I got separated from my

Man: The Empire has set up
camp just beyond the forest to
the east.
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: The Empire!? What
are they doing here?
[NEWPAGE]
Man: They seem to have their
eyes on Doma Castle.
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: So Doma's next,
huh…? But I need to get to
Narshe right away!
[NEWPAGE]
Man: Your only road passes
through Doma. I can take you
there if you'd like.

Baram: Guess it's time we start
thinking of a name, huh?
[NEWPAGE]
Clyde: A name?
[NEWPAGE]
Baram: All good bandit duos

have one in mind…

Clyde: Well? Let's hear it!

Baram: …
"The [SHADOW] Bandits"!
What do you think?
Not bad, eh?

Clyde: The [SHADOW] Bandits,
great train robbers of the

Clyde: Don't worry, you're

Baram: I'm sorry… I… I let my

Clyde: Don't talk! The town's

Baram: You don't have to
pretend. I know. This is… my

Please, finish me off with your

Baram: You know what they'll

I don't want to have to go

Oh, this is no good! No good at

Thank goodness!

Oh, dear… There's a dragon

Whew!

Looks like you saved the day

Soldier: Who goes there!?
--------------------
Soldier A: Shhh! I just told you
to keep it down! How many
times are you gonna make me
say it?
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier A: You've gotta be more
careful! General Leo may be a
decent man, but Kefka… that
guy's twisted!
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier B: Tell me about it…
--------------------
[SABIN]: What the…?
Why are there so many troops
here?
--------------------
Captain: You there! We're about
to storm the castle.
[NEWPAGE]
The two of you will join the
assault squad. Get moving!

(BLANK LINE: 0x524440)

Soldier: Swine!
--------------------
An Imperial camp…
There are an awful lot of
soldiers here…
--------------------
Soldier A: Hey, did you hear?
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier B: Oh, you mean--
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier A: Shhh! Keep your voice
down! If Kefka catches us,
we're toast!
--------------------
Soldier A: They say Kefka's
plotting to drive away General
Leo so he can take over his
position as general…
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier B: Don't even joke about
something like that. If that
freak becomes our general, I'll
quit!
--------------------
Soldier A: Shhh! What if he
hears you? You'll be locked up!
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier B: All right, all right!
--------------------
Soldier B: Uh-oh… Here he
comes! Quick, back to your post!
--------------------
Kefka: Hey, you! You keeping a
sharp lookout? Hmm?
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier A: Yes, sir! Kefka, sir!
What a pleasant surprise! How
are you today, sir?
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: Please, spare me your
petty small talk! Just do your
job!
[NEWPAGE]
And don't let me catch you
slacking, or I'll make you
regret being born!
--------------------
Soldier B: Hmph! Like we're
gonna listen to you, you
pompous little…
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier B: What's wrong with
that guy, anyway?
[NEWPAGE]
It's like General Leo got all the
good qualities a man could
have, and Kefka got stuck with
the rest…
--------------------
Soldier: General Leo, sir. The
Domans appear to be playing a
waiting game.
[NEWPAGE]
Leo: So, they're using their
favorite strategy…
--------------------
Soldier: General… We're ready
to storm the castle as soon as
you give the order…
[NEWPAGE]
Leo: Patience! If we attack
now, there will be too many
unnecessary casualties.
--------------------
Soldier: But… General! I'm
prepared to lay down my life
for the Empire at any time!
--------------------
Leo: You're from Maranda, are
you not?
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: Huh? I mean, yes, sir, I
am, but… why do you ask, sir?
--------------------
Leo: You would have me go
there and deliver the news of
your passing to your family?
[NEWPAGE]
What would I say when I hand
them your sword? How could
I even look at them?
[NEWPAGE]
You're a human being before
you're a soldier. Don't be so
eager to throw away your life.
[NEWPAGE]
Emperor Gestahl wouldn't want
you to die for nothing.
--------------------
Soldier: Yes, sir!
--------------------
Soldier: General Leo, sir!
--------------------
Soldier: Hey! What do you think
you're doing!?
--------------------
Soldier: A carrier pigeon
arrived from Emperor Gestahl!
--------------------
Leo: What…?
--------------------
Leo: The emperor summons me.
I must return at once.
--------------------
Soldier: Understood, sir.
--------------------
Leo: I'll leave the rest in your
hands.
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: Yes, sir.
[NEWPAGE]
Leo: Listen to me… Don't rush
things. That's all I ask.
--------------------
Soldier: Sir! Leave it to us, sir!

Leo: I'm counting on you.
--------------------
So that's General Leo… [LONGPAUSE]He may
be an enemy, but he seems like
a decent man.

Whew… That was close!

Urgh! It won't open.

Soldier: …?
I know I heard something…
[NEWPAGE]
"Meooow!"
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: Oh. Just a stupid cat…
--------------------
Kefka: Once Leo's gone, I can
turn this water into a flowing
river of poison!
[NEWPAGE]
Anyone who touches it'll be
pushing up daisies! Hee-hee…
--------------------
Leo: I'm afraid the emperor has
called me back home. Try not to
cause any trouble in my
absence.
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: Hmph! I'll take care of
things faster than you ever
would!
--------------------
Leo: Nothing dirty, Kefka!
[NEWPAGE]
They may be our enemies, but
they're still human beings. Try
not to forget that.
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: We needn't show mercy
to those who side with the
Returners.
[NEWPAGE]
…Which is good, because I
never seem to have any of the
stuff.
--------------------
Kefka: Yes, you just go off and
be a good little boy…
--------------------
Kefka: Is the poison ready?
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: But, General Leo said--
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: Leo's not here anymore.
I'm in charge now. Fork it over!
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: Some of our people are
being held prisoner inside the
castle! If any of them were to
drink the water…
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: Who cares? They're the
ones who were stupid enough
to get caught by the enemy!
--------------------
You're inhuman!
--------------------
Kefka: Gah…! Pests at every
turn! Guess I'll have to take
care of you, too!
--------------------
Kefka: Pestering little…!
Really want me to let you have
it, do you!?
--------------------
Kefka: *gasp* *pant*
You just don't give up, do you?
--------------------
Kefka: Gah! How long do you
expect me to put up with this?
Next time I won't hold back!
--------------------
Wait!
--------------------
Kefka: Oh, gripe! This is getting
tiresome. Hey, you! Handle the
rest!
--------------------
No! Gotta hurry, or Kefka will
dump the poison into the river!
--------------------
Kefka: Hee-hee… Nothing beats
the sweet music of hundreds of
voices screaming in unison!
[NEWPAGE]
Uwee-hee-hee!
--------------------
Captain: Charge!
--------------------
Doman Sentry: It's hopeless!
We can't keep them all out.

Doman Sentry: So, this is it…
--------------------
Wait!
--------------------
The battle is not yet lost!
--------------------
[CYAN]: If we can but fell
their commander, they should
break rank and withdraw.
--------------------
[CYAN]: I shall meet him on
the field of battle.
--------------------
[CYAN]: I must not turn my
back to the battle at hand!
--------------------
Doman Sentry: Sir [CYAN]!
Please, defeat their
commander!
--------------------
Doman Sentry: Sir [CYAN]!

[CYAN]: I am [CYAN],
retainer to the king of Doma.
Ready thy axe!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Hmm…?
Does the water not look a
bit… odd?

Soldier: The captain's been
defeated! Retreat!

I cannot see your face…

[CYAN]: Excellency!
Please, you must be strong!
[NEWPAGE]
King: [CYAN]…

You have defended this realm
since the days of my father
before me… I thank you… for
your service. Urgh…
[NEWPAGE]
Forgive me… I failed to protect
our kingdom…
--------------------
…

[CYAN]: Elayne! [LONGPAUSE]
Do not leave me, Elayne!
--------------------
[CYAN]: This… [LONGPAUSE]
This is unpardonable…
--------------------
[CYAN]: …! [LONGPAUSE]
Owain!!!
--------------------
A noble warrior of a foreign
land. A faithful retainer to his
lord and master, he fears not
even death…
--------------------
There's a great deal of activity
in the Imperial camp. I think
they may be preparing another
assault!
--------------------
Doman Sentry: What low-down,
contemptible…!
--------------------
[CYAN]: We must warn the
king!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Withdraw into the
castle.
[NEWPAGE]
We shall wait within its walls,
while our enemies grow tired
without.
--------------------
[CYAN]: No… [LONGPAUSE]No…!
--------------------
Doman Sentry: We were… too
late…
--------------------
Doman Sentry: To the king, with
all haste!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Yes!
The throne room is just ahead!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Excellency…
--------------------
[CYAN]: There may still be
survivors in the castle!
[NEWPAGE]
Doman Sentry: Let's split up and
search…
--------------------
[CYAN]: Here, too…
--------------------
[CYAN]: No… No… [LONGPAUSE]
This cannot be happening!
--------------------
[CYAN]: I will not forgive
them…! [LONGPAUSE]The Empire must pay
for this!
--------------------
Soldier: This area's off-limits.
--------------------
[CYAN]: I am [CYAN],
retainer to the king of Doma!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Grrr!
There will be no mercy for
thee! [PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[CYAN]: Gaaah!
Who poisoned the river!? [PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
Soldier: Enemy!!!
All men, to your positions!
--------------------
[SABIN]: That guy's a goner
on his own! Gotta help him…
and fast!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Whoa!
[NEWPAGE]
There's still poison all over the
place! Going through here would
be suicide!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Let me give you a
hand!
--------------------
[CYAN]: I know not thy
name or allegiance, but I
welcome thy aid!
--------------------
[SABIN]: These ones next!?
--------------------
[CYAN]: Grrr!
They are tougher than they
would appear!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Look, I think we're
gonna have to do this together!
--------------------
[CYAN]: The thought had
occurred to me as well!
--------------------
[SABIN]: I'm [SABIN],
from the kingdom of Figaro.
[NEWPAGE]
We can talk more later. Let's
get out of here!
--------------------
[CYAN]: I am in thy debt!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Grrr!
Art thou an enemy as well!?
--------------------
[SABIN]: Ouch!
Probably shouldn't have gotten
in the middle of that…
--------------------
[SABIN]: !!! [PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[SABIN]: No need for thanks!
I'm [SABIN], from the
kingdom of Figaro.
[NEWPAGE]
We should get out of here!
--------------------
[CYAN]: But I must avenge
my family and my countrymen!
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: If we stick around
any longer, we'll have an entire
regiment down our throats!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Sir [SABIN]!
It appears to be in reverse! [PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[SABIN]: Yeah, yeah…
Come on!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Aaahhh!
I cannot stop this monstrosity!!![PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[SABIN]: Okay, let's bust our
way out of here!
--------------------
Hold it right there!
--------------------
Here they come! Stop them!
--------------------
Did you really think you'd get
away?
--------------------
[SABIN]: Okay, I think we
should be safe now! So, how do
I get to Narshe from here?
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: Narshe?
[NEWPAGE]
I believe the only route passes
through the forest to the
south, but--
--------------------
[SABIN]: All right!
[NEWPAGE]
If we're going into the woods, I
guess we won't be needing
these hunks of scrap metal
anymore.
[NEWPAGE]
Let's get going!
--------------------
[SABIN]: There's nothing but
poison that way!
--------------------
Soldier: There they are!
This way!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Hoo, boy…
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: I have an idea…
Follow me.
--------------------
[CYAN]: Sir [SABIN]!
What manner of armored
beasts might these be?
--------------------
[SABIN]: I'll explain later!
Just climb in!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Sir [SABIN]!
How does one manipulate
these abominations?
--------------------
[SABIN]: Oh, for…!
[NEWPAGE]
Thou art getting to be quite a
pain in the-- [LONGPAUSE]Great, now I'm
even starting to talk like you!

See that lever? The one right

[NEWPAGE]
Despite all of our recent
advances in technology, the
outside world remains full of
monsters we know little about.
[NEWPAGE]
Here, we provide advice to
travelers brave enough to face
its many dangers.
--------------------
Welcome to our school for
budding adventurers.
[NEWPAGE]
We're always here to help you
find your way in the world…
or at least what's left of it.
--------------------
This is water from a recovery
spring.
[NEWPAGE]
It will restore your HP and MP.
Such springs are located all
throughout the world, so
always be on the lookout!
--------------------
This is a save point.
--------------------
Valuables are sometimes hidden
in pots such as this one.
--------------------
Potions may taste funny, but
they also heal injury. If you
are hurt, drink one to restore
some HP.
[NEWPAGE]
Staying at an inn will
completely heal your entire
party.
--------------------
Be careful! Sometimes
monsters lurk inside of
treasure chests!
--------------------
Have you heard about relics?
--------------------
Make selections using the
A Button. Cancel them with the
B Button. Press the X Button to
open the main menu.
--------------------
When selecting armor or
weapons in a shop, symbols will
appear next to characters that
can equip them.
[NEWPAGE]
An upward-pointing triangle
indicates an increase in attack
or defense power.
[NEWPAGE]
A downward-pointing triangle
indicates a decrease in attack
or defense power.
[NEWPAGE]
"[72]" indicates no change.
"E" means that the item is
already equipped on that
character.
[NEWPAGE]
A symbol beneath a character
means that person is currently
in your party.
--------------------
If you set the battle mode to
"Wait" in the Config menu…
[NEWPAGE]
…you can take all the time you
want to select spells or items
in battle without having to
worry about being attacked!
--------------------
You can run from most battles
by holding down both the L and
R Buttons.
--------------------
Turn meters are located in the
lower right-hand corner of the
battle screen.
[NEWPAGE]
When a character's turn meter
becomes full, you will be able
to enter battle commands for
that character.
[NEWPAGE]
Press the X or Y Button to skip
to a different character
without entering a command.
--------------------
When selecting the target for a
spell, press the L or R Button to
target all enemies or all allies.
--------------------
When the battle menu appears,
press Left or Right to select
"Row" or "Defend".
[NEWPAGE]
"Row" moves the character
from the front row to the
back, or vice versa.
[NEWPAGE]
"Defend" cuts received damage
in half, and lasts until the
character's next turn.
--------------------
Damage is more severe when
enemies have you surrounded,
especially if your back is to the
one attacking!
--------------------
The white numbers that appear
during battle are damage
points. Green numbers are
recovery points.
--------------------
Damage received by characters
in the back row is halved, but
so is the attack power of those
characters.
[NEWPAGE]
To change rows from the main
menu, press Left, then select a
character and press the
A Button twice.
--------------------
Shall I teach you about status
effects?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
(Invisible)
Physical attacks will miss, but
spells will always strike true.
You'll revert if hit by magic.
[NEWPAGE]
(Toad)
Prevents you from using special
skills and magic.
[NEWPAGE]
(Zombie)
Zombies attack friend and foe.
Only holy water can cure this
status.
[NEWPAGE]
If your skin is ashen, if your HP
is 0, and if you're still moving,
you're probably a zombie.
[NEWPAGE]
(Sleep and Confuse)
These status ailments are
cancelled when the character
is attacked.
--------------------
Undead creatures such as
ghosts are damaged by
curative spells and items.
--------------------
(Sap)
HP gradually decreases.
[NEWPAGE]
(Regen)
HP gradually recovers.
--------------------
Fire, ice, and lightning are the
three principle elements.
[NEWPAGE]
They are represented by the
spells Fire, Blizzard, and
Thunder, respectively.
--------------------
The Reflect spell remains active
for only a short time and will
not reflect blue magic.
--------------------
(Runic)
Absorbs magic and converts it
into MP.
[NEWPAGE]
Runic remains active until a
spell is absorbed or another
command is given.
[NEWPAGE]
(Morph)
Boosts attack and magic.
The duration increases as more
battles are fought.
[NEWPAGE]
(Rage)
Once selected, this command is
used continuously until the end
of battle.
--------------------
(Mirage)
Creates illusionary images of a
character, making it difficult
for enemies to hit them.
--------------------
You might find this room more
useful after you've gained
some experience out in the
world.
[NEWPAGE]
A lot of the things you'll hear in
here might not make much
sense until you've gotten your
feet wet.
--------------------
Desperate times can bring out
strength you never knew you
had!
[NEWPAGE]
Critically wounded characters
may occasionally perform
powerful, hidden techniques
when you select "Attack".
--------------------
It seems you have some
magicite…
[NEWPAGE]
Want to learn more about
espers?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
To use an esper, you must first
equip its magicite. Select
"Skills" from the main menu,
then select "Espers".
[NEWPAGE]
To summon the esper in battle,
select "Magic", press Up, then
select the esper with the
A Button.
[NEWPAGE]
Note that there is NO limit to
the number of times you can
summon a single esper per
battle.
[NEWPAGE]

[CENTER](Learning Magic)
[NEWPAGE]
A character slowly learns spells
when an esper is equipped.
The set of spells each esper
teaches is different.
[NEWPAGE]
The higher a spell's mastery
rate, the faster it will be
learned.
[NEWPAGE]
Additionally, some espers can
increase a character's
maximum HP or MP when the
character gains a level.
--------------------
The Config menu includes an
all-new music player.
Press the A Button while
"Sound" is selected to access it.
[NEWPAGE]
You can listen to all of your
favorite pieces of music, and
more!
[NEWPAGE]
(Note: FF6 T-Edition is many
 years old. Some music might
 play incorrectly on hardware
 and on modern emulators.)
--------------------
Something to note about the
Reflect spell… Reflect doesn't
block spells that have already
been reflected once.
[NEWPAGE]
You can use this to your
advantage.
[NEWPAGE]
Cast Reflect on an ally, then
cast attack spells on that same
person to bounce them at an
enemy! …Get it?
--------------------
Status effects are represented
by different colors.

Keep away from the engine
room. It's dangerous.
--------------------
We're almost to Crescent
Island.
--------------------
This Magitek armor's
undergoing maintenance.
--------------------
[CELES]: Um, [LOCKE]…
--------------------
Rumor has it that the lost
power of magic can still be
found on Crescent Island,
weak though it may be.
--------------------
We need to find the espers
quickly so we can make peace
with them!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Huh?
Where's [GAU]?
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: He must not like
boats. [LONGPAUSE]Oh well…
Guess it's just the two of us!
--------------------
Soldier: The engines are all
running smoothly, sir.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Urgh… [LONGPAUSE]Ohhh… [LONGPAUSE]
Uhhhn…
--------------------
Waiter: Please be seated if you
wish to order.
--------------------
[SABIN]: All right! Chow time!
I'm gonna eat till I burst!
--------------------
We need to get off the train!
--------------------
Waiter: Will you be dining with
us?
[CHOICE] Yes!
[CHOICE] No thanks…
--------------------
[SABIN]: Food! Food!
Bring me everything you've got!
--------------------
[SABIN]: What are you
worried about? [LONGPAUSE]
You can't wage war on an
empty stomach!
--------------------
[CYAN]: *sigh*
[NEWPAGE]
Do what thou wilt, sir. [LONGPAUSE]
I'm sure there is no stopping
thee…
--------------------
[SABIN]: Whew! I'm stuffed! [LONGPAUSE]
Shall we get moving?
--------------------
Waiter: One moment, please.
--------------------
[CYAN]: Is this train's food
tr-truly safe to eat?
--------------------
[SHADOW]: … [LONGPAUSE]
Interceptor… Are you hungry,
too, boy?
--------------------
*gobble* [LONGPAUSE]*snarf* [LONGPAUSE]*slurp*
--------------------
Conductor: You want to stop
the train?
[NEWPAGE]
Search every corner of the
engineer's compartment…
I'm sure there's a way.
--------------------
Conductor: I'm this train's
conductor. What business
brings you here?
[NEWPAGE]
[CHOICE] Tell us about the train
[CHOICE] How do we stop this thing?
[CHOICE] Nothing, sorry to bother you
--------------------
Conductor: The Phantom Train
ferries the souls of the
departed to the other side.
[NEWPAGE]
Once the souls arrive, they are
granted their eternal rest.
--------------------
That should be the end of that…
--------------------
[CYAN]: Might these be
timetables?
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: These?
…Huh? They're all blank!
--------------------
Conductor: This train carries
the dead to the afterlife.
[NEWPAGE]
It's a little tough to be making
timetables with as much
conflict in the world as there is
right now.
--------------------
[SABIN]: Wonder what this is
for…? Why don't we see what
happens if we pull it?
--------------------
[CYAN]: Sir [SABIN]!
I think it would be best not to
touch that!
--------------------
[SABIN]: [CYAN]…
You're not… scared, are you!?
--------------------
[SABIN]: Oops! My hand
must've slipped!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Oh, thou art truly
insufferable…
--------------------
[CYAN]: Wh-what!?
--------------------
[CYAN]: Wh-what dost thou
mean? It's not as though I have
an aversion to machines…
[NEWPAGE]
…or try to stay away from
them as much as humanly
possible… or anything like that!
--------------------
[SABIN]: [CYAN]…
So, you're afraid of machines!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Argh!
Wh-what gave it away?
--------------------
[CYAN]: A train!? [LONGPAUSE]I thought
all of Doma's railways had been
destroyed in the fighting…
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: There could be
survivors. Let's take a look
inside.
--------------------
[CYAN]: Sir [SABIN]!
--------------------
[SABIN]: We can't just
wander around out here all
day. We have to check inside!
--------------------
[SABIN]: What in the
world…?
--------------------
[CYAN]: We must leave at
once! This is the Phantom Train!
--------------------
[CYAN]: It seems we have
arrived.
--------------------
[SABIN]: Whew!
Glad to be off that thing!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Hey! [LONGPAUSE]
Looks like we can get in
through here.
--------------------
Whew… What do you suppose
that was all about?
--------------------
Huh!?
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]. . . N o . . . e s c a p e . . .
--------------------
Who's there!?
--------------------
It came from over here.
--------------------
Gah! They're coming after us…!
--------------------
There are more of them this
way!
--------------------
Nowhere to run… [PAUSE_01]
     Nowhere to hide… [PAUSE_01]
          No escape for you…
--------------------
They just don't let up!
--------------------
[CYAN]: I believe we have
reached a dead end, Sir
[SABIN]!
--------------------
[SABIN]: All right!
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: Hast thou an idea?
--------------------
[SABIN]: Yes… [LONGPAUSE]
The time has come to put my
training to use!
[NEWPAGE]
Come, [CYAN]!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Yahoooo!
--------------------
Hey… [LONGPAUSE]They couldn't still be…?
--------------------
????: Hold it right there!
--------------------
Gilgamesh: I am Gilgamesh,
greatest swordsman in all the
world! And that treasure
belongs to me!
[NEWPAGE]
If I were you, you
over-muscled moose, I'd grab
Grandpa there and scram while
you still can!
--------------------
[SABIN]: World's greatest
swordsman? Yeah, right.
If anything, I suggest YOU leave
before you get hurt.
[NEWPAGE]
Gilgamesh: What!? How dare
you speak to me that way, you
lowly meathead!
[NEWPAGE]
Prepare yourself! Yours will be
the blood that rusts my blade!
--------------------
All bark, no bite…
--------------------
Gilgamesh: N-no! This can't be! [LONGPAUSE]
Well, no matter… The last laugh
is mine!
--------------------
Gilgamesh: Uwahaha!
The treasure is mine!
So long, suckers!
--------------------
We'll have to detach the rear
cars!
--------------------
This is the engineer's
compartment. We've gotta find
a way to stop this thing, fast!
--------------------
Something's written here!
Hmm…
[NEWPAGE]
"To stop the train, shut the
[SPACE_07]first and third pressure
[SPACE_07]valves, then throw the switch
[SPACE_07]located by the smokestack."
--------------------
The train should stop if we
throw this switch.
--------------------
Just push this switch, and… [LONGPAUSE]
Huh? Nothing happened!
--------------------
[SABIN]: The door won't
open!
--------------------
[CYAN]: I fear we are too
late.
--------------------
[SABIN]: What did you say
this train was?
--------------------
[CYAN]: This is the Phantom
Train…
[NEWPAGE]
It carries the souls of the
departed to their… final
destination.
--------------------
[SABIN]: …Wait a second.
[NEWPAGE]
You're saying this train's giving
us a one-way ride to… the
afterlife!?
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: Unless we find a
way off, I am afraid that is
exactly where we will end up…
--------------------
[SABIN]: Well, I'm afraid
that's a trip I'm going to have
to pass on!
[NEWPAGE]
If it won't let us off, then we'll
stop it ourselves. Let's make
for the engine.
--------------------
Look out!
--------------------
[SABIN]: What's with this
guy?
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: He seems to want
to accompany us.
[NEWPAGE]
Bring the ghost along?
[CHOICE] Sure.
[CHOICE] No way!
--------------------
[SABIN]: But…
The greater our numbers, the
slower we'll move.
[NEWPAGE]
…Maybe another time!
--------------------
You're leaving?
--------------------
Guess we're on our own again…
--------------------
Howdy, folks! I've got
top-quality items at
rock-bottom prices!
[NEWPAGE]
No reason to be overcharging
now… like they say, you can't
take it with you!
[NEWPAGE]
[CHOICE] (Shop)
[CHOICE] (Don't shop)
--------------------
[SABIN]: It's moving!
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: We must get off
this train at once!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Don't worry, it'll
only take a second!
--------------------
Phantom Train: So! You're the
ones who have been slowing
me down!
--------------------
Phantom Train: I will let you
go… [LONGPAUSE]But first there is
something I must do…
--------------------
[CYAN]: Elayne! [PAUSE_01][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
…The train's leaving!?
--------------------
[SABIN]: [CYAN]!
Was that your wife and son!?
--------------------
[CYAN]: Is that…!? [LONGPAUSE]
Elayne! [LONGPAUSE]Owain!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Please, wait! [PAUSE_01][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[SABIN]: The faster we leave
that train behind, the better!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Owain… [PAUSE_01][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
My love…
You made me so happy.
Thank you… [PAUSE_03][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
Dad!
I'll keep practicing with my
sword so I can keep Mom safe! [PAUSE_08][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Best leave him be.
--------------------
[CYAN]: …
--------------------
[SABIN]: This must be Baren
Falls…
--------------------
[CYAN]: To the south of
here lies the Veldt.
[NEWPAGE]
'Tis a wild and dangerous land,
inhabited by all manner of
ferocious beasts…
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: But if we turn
around and go back, the Empire
will be waiting for us.
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: Hmm…
The village of Mobliz lies on the
eastern coast.
[NEWPAGE]
If we can make it through the
Veldt, we could head there…
--------------------
[SABIN]: [SHADOW]!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Thanks for your
help! Let's team up again
sometime!
--------------------
[SHADOW]: I have served my
purpose…
--------------------
Dive into the falls?
[CHOICE] (Jump)
[CHOICE] (Stay put)
--------------------
A youth draped in monster
hides, his eyes shining with a
warm and gentle light…
--------------------
Who… are…?
--------------------
You came down Baren Falls?
[NEWPAGE]
Unbelievable! It's flowing even
stronger than usual this year.
No one's been able to get here
lately!
--------------------
Carrier pigeons are our only
link to the outside world.
--------------------
Is it true that war has broken
out? I got a letter saying that
it had!
--------------------
Duane and Katarin are both
sixteen. Ah, what a magical age!
The springtime of love…
--------------------
Katarin: …
--------------------
Duane: …
--------------------
Did you see the house on the
far northern plains?
[NEWPAGE]
That old man has lost his
marbles. They say he threw out
his own kid, thinking he was
some kind of monster!
--------------------
This region's known as the
Veldt.
[NEWPAGE]
Monsters migrate here from all
over the world, so it can be
quite dangerous outside of
town.
[NEWPAGE]
You never know what you
might run into.
--------------------
Out hunting yesterday, I
could've sworn I saw a kid
running along with a pack of
monsters!
[NEWPAGE]
Wonder if it was just my
overactive imagination…
--------------------
Powerful ocean currents run
through the Serpent Trench.
[NEWPAGE]
Have you ever heard about
them?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
If you had a diving helmet, you
could make it all the way to
Nikeah.
--------------------
Hop into the current, and you'd
be swept straight to Nikeah!
Too bad our only diving helmet
was stolen…
--------------------
A grievously injured soldier
wandered into the village not
too long ago.
[NEWPAGE]
I dressed his wounds, but his
condition doesn't seem to be
improving…
[NEWPAGE]
Those letters coming from the
town of Maranda are the only
things keeping him going…
--------------------
The soldier inside this house is
hurt real bad, so Mom says we
have to keep our voices down.
--------------------
Shhh! You have to be quiet!
--------------------
I threw some dried meat to a
herd of hungry animals last
time I was out on the Veldt…
[NEWPAGE]
And would you believe it?
Some kid scrambled out of the
herd and ran off with it!
--------------------
Let me know if you need
anything. I can send letters and
packages to any corner of the
world for you!
--------------------
The entrance to the Serpent
Trench lies within Crescent
Mountain, near the southern tip
of the continent.
--------------------
Injured Lad: I'm a soldier from
Maranda. When our town fell to
the Empire, I was forced to
join the Imperial army.
[NEWPAGE]
I tried to flee, rather than help
them attack Doma, but they
came after me… I barely
escaped alive.
[NEWPAGE]
Now I can't even move. [LONGPAUSE]
I'll never see Lola again…
[NEWPAGE]
There's a letter on the desk.
Would you be kind enough to
bring it to me?
--------------------
"There are even more Imperial
[SPACE_07]soldiers walking the streets of
[SPACE_07]Maranda these days, but things
[SPACE_07]are peaceful otherwise."
[NEWPAGE]
"The flowers in the garden will
[SPACE_07]soon bloom, and announce the
[SPACE_07]arrival of spring."
[NEWPAGE]
"How are you doing? I'm
[SPACE_07]worried. I so wish that I could
[SPACE_07]fly to your side and be with
[SPACE_07]you!"
[NEWPAGE]
"Please think only about getting
[SPACE_07]better, and try not to push
[SPACE_07]yourself too hard."
[NEWPAGE]
"Rest knowing that I spend
[SPACE_07]every day thinking of you,
[SPACE_07]and wishing I could see you…
[SPACE_20]- Lola"
--------------------
I'd like to write her back, but I
don't even have the strength to
pick up a pen.
--------------------
So, you want to send a letter to
Lola for that injured soldier…
[NEWPAGE]
Postage to Maranda is 500 Gil.
[CHOICE] (Send it)
[CHOICE] (Forget it)
--------------------
I want to get better so I can
return to Maranda… I want to
see Lola…
--------------------
Another letter arrived. Could
you bring it to me?
--------------------
"I can't find your favorite
[SPACE_07]record. I thought if I played
[SPACE_07]it, it might feel like you
[SPACE_07]were here with me again…"
--------------------
You can send a record for 500
Gil.
[CHOICE] (Send it)
[CHOICE] (Forget it)
--------------------
"Mother has taken ill, and we
[SPACE_07]can't afford to buy medicine.
[SPACE_07]If only we had some more
[SPACE_07]potions…"
--------------------
You can send a potion for 500
Gil.
[CHOICE] (Send it)
[CHOICE] (Forget it)
--------------------
"I haven't heard from you for
[SPACE_07]some time now, and I'm
[SPACE_07]beginning to worry…"
--------------------
You can send a letter for 500
Gil.
[CHOICE] (Send it)
[CHOICE] (Forget it)
--------------------
"You mentioned a book in your
[SPACE_07]last letter. Someday you'll
[SPACE_07]have to let me read it, too…"
--------------------
You can send a book for 500 Gil.
[CHOICE] (Send it)
[CHOICE] (Forget it)
--------------------
He wrote me back! He's all
right… Oh, thank goodness…
--------------------
He sent me a record!
I'm so happy!
--------------------
He sent a potion for Mother…
He's so kind…
--------------------
He sent me the book he'd been
reading! I've been reading a
little bit every night before
bed. I'll treasure it forever!
--------------------
My beloved hasn't replied to my
letter… I'm sick with worry…
--------------------
I'd do anything for Lola…
If only I could move…
--------------------
I heard. You've been sending
Lola all kinds of things in my
name…
[NEWPAGE]
I wish to thank you from the
bottom of my heart. [LONGPAUSE]Please,
accept this as a token of my
appreciation.
[NEWPAGE]
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Received Lunar Curtain!
--------------------
[GAU]: Treasure, treasure!
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: 'Tis nothing but a
dirty glass bowl…
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Kind of looks like it
would fit over your head…
--------------------
[SABIN]: Hmm…!
I wonder if we could use this?
--------------------
[SABIN]: It might let us
breathe underwater.
--------------------
[SABIN]: [CYAN]!
That "shiny, shiny" thing of
[GAU]'s is in here.
--------------------
[CYAN]: And where exactly
might it be, Sir [GAU]?
--------------------
[GAU]: [GAU]… forget!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Shall we look
around?
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: It seems we have
no choice!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Doesn't seem to
be over here…
--------------------
[SABIN]: A potion…
--------------------
[CYAN]: C-could this be
Sir [GAU]'s treasure!?
--------------------
[SABIN]: What is it,
[GAU]…? Did you see
something?
--------------------
[GAU]: WAOU!!!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Gah!
My money pouch! There was
five hundred Gil in there!
--------------------
[CYAN]: These rapids look
quite… rapid.
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: No kidding.
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: But it's the only
way to make it in time to meet
up with the others…
--------------------
[SABIN]: [GAU], you
little…!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Oh, dear…
Sir [SABIN], please let it go…
For all of our sakes.
--------------------
[CYAN]: Sir [SABIN]…
Recall that thou entrusted me
with thy coin.
[NEWPAGE]
Your Gil is right here, safe and
sound.
--------------------
[SABIN]: Grrrrr!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Is this it? [LONGPAUSE]
The shiny treasure?
--------------------
[SABIN]: All right, let's go!
--------------------
This is Nikeah, one of the few
port towns in the world.
--------------------
We used to be a booming trade
town, but then the Empire
started enacting all kinds of
strict new regulations…
[NEWPAGE]
Business is all but dead here
now.
--------------------
So, the kingdom of Doma to the
east has fallen into the hands
of the Empire as well?
--------------------
Get out of my way! Hmph!
Standing around in the street
like that, all covered in filth…!
--------------------
This island's isolated from the
rest of the world, so you can't
get anywhere without a ship!
By the way…
[NEWPAGE]
…what does "isolated" mean?
--------------------
A rockslide has blocked the
route that used to lead north
along the coast.
--------------------
The route north is finally clear
again.
--------------------
This ferry's bound for South
Figaro.
[CHOICE] (Still need to shop)
[CHOICE] (Hop aboard)
--------------------
The Empire took over our
destination port, so we're stuck
here for the time being.
--------------------
This ferry's bound for Nikeah.
[CHOICE] (Still need to shop)
[CHOICE] (Hop aboard)
--------------------
Ships used to sail to the towns
of the southern continent as
well. Tzen, Albrook, Maranda…
[NEWPAGE]
All of them have been lost to
the Empire…
--------------------
Know that strange old man?
Lives in a little cabin near the
Lethe? I 'elped deliver 'is son
thirteen years ago.
[NEWPAGE]
It was a problem birth. The
mother didn't survive, and the
man couldn't take it… went
loony, 'e did!
[NEWPAGE]
Thought 'is baby was some kind
of monster and threw it out!
Poor little thing never even 'ad
a chance…
--------------------
Dancer: Hey, you handsome
young thing… Why don't you
come have a drink with me?
Tee-hee!
--------------------
[CYAN]: H-how dare you!?
Licentious howler!
Off… off with thee!
--------------------
Dancer: Oh, don't be a stick in
the mud! Let's just have some
fun!
[NEWPAGE]
Hey, do you like these? I call
this one Humpty, and this one
Dumpty!
--------------------
[CYAN]: H-Humpty!?
D-Dumpty!?
--------------------
[SABIN]: [CYAN],
you're too easy!
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: Th-thou art
unaffected by these… charms!?
--------------------
[SABIN]: One of the benefits
of all my years of ascetic
training!
--------------------
Dancer: Oh, don't leave me
standing here all alone!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Enough of that!
A proper woman should have
modesty, and… and decency!
[NEWPAGE]
And…
*rant* *rant* *rant*
--------------------
Oh, [CYAN]…!
--------------------
Pretty impressive that a kid
like me can run a business,
don't ya think?
[NEWPAGE]
You should buy something to
encourage me!
--------------------
All this stuff looks like junk to
me…
--------------------
I'm shopping for imported
goods.
--------------------
[CYAN]: Narshe is just a
stone's throw away.
--------------------
[SABIN]: I wonder if the
others arrived safely…
--------------------
[CYAN]: I am sure they did.
--------------------
[GAU]: Uwao…
--------------------
Aged Man: If you're not a
repairman, you've got no
business here! Git! Scram!
--------------------
[GAU]: Uwao…o…
--------------------
Aged Man: Come to think of it, I
haven't seen that repairman
for a while. Tough fella, looked
like a big, lumberin' bear…
--------------------
Aged Man: Oh, hello again! It's
been a while. Let me tell you,
those repairs of yours were
top notch!
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: I told you, I'm
not--
[NEWPAGE]
Aged Man: Now, hurry up and
fix that chair over there!
You're gonna need to stand on
it so you can fix the roof!
--------------------
[SABIN]: You don't
suppose…?
[NEWPAGE]
…Could this guy be
[GAU]'s father?
--------------------
[GAU]: …Fa-ther?
--------------------
Elder: I understand what you're
saying. But… you're asking us to
spill our blood for you.
[NEWPAGE]
Arvis: That's not what we
asked!
[NEWPAGE]
Elder: What you ask is the
same.
--------------------
Banon: Ha! You're absolutely
right.
--------------------
Arvis: Banon!
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: We're asking you to spill
your blood.
--------------------
Banon: Emperor Gestahl is
racing to acquire ever greater
Magitek power.
[NEWPAGE]
That's the reason he wants the
esper that was discovered
here.
[NEWPAGE]
If we allow the Empire to
continue amassing weapons of
Magitek destruction…
[NEWPAGE]
…history's greatest mistake
will be repeated.
--------------------
Elder: The War of the Magi…
--------------------
"The legendary conflict that
[SPACE_07]laid waste to the world…"
"You're saying it could happen
[SPACE_07]again?"
[NEWPAGE]
Elder: I had thought humans to
be wiser creatures…
--------------------
[CYAN]: I am [CYAN],
a warrior of the kingdom of
Doma.
--------------------
[GAU]: Uwao… [GAU]!
--------------------
[SABIN]: The Empire killed
everyone in Doma, down to the
last child…
--------------------
[CYAN]: Kefka… poisoned
them…
--------------------
Elder: Barbaric!
--------------------
Banon: Elder!
[NEWPAGE]
Elder: But… that was because
Doma was collaborating with
the Returners.
[NEWPAGE]
As long as we remain neutral,
we have nothing to fear from
the Empire.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Think again!
--------------------
[TERRA]: [LOCKE]!
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: The Empire's poised
to attack Narshe as we speak!
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: What!?
--------------------
Banon: [LOCKE], where did
you manage to get your hands
on information like that?
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: [CELES] here
was one of the Empire's
gener--
--------------------
[CYAN]: So it is her!
I thought she looked familiar.
Sir [GAU], step aside!
--------------------
[CYAN]: The infamous
General [CELES]…
[NEWPAGE]
The woman single-handedly
responsible for the decimation
of Maranda…
[NEWPAGE]
Stand and meet thy judgment,
Imperial b--
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Wait!
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES] has promised to join
the Returners! She's fighting on
our side now!
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: Be that as it may…!
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: I promised I'd
protect her, and I won't give up
a woman I've sworn to protect!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: [LOCKE]…
You still haven't gotten over
that, have you…?
--------------------
[TERRA]: I was also an
Imperial soldier.
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: WHAT!?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: The Empire is evil,
but that doesn't mean that all
of its citizens are.
--------------------
The Empire is here!
We're under attack!!!
--------------------
Kefka: I don't care what you
have to do, just get me that
esper!
--------------------
Soldier: Kefka, sir… What about
the civilians?
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: What about them? Kill
them all!
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: But, sir, Narshe is a
neutral city…!
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: Idiot!
--------------------
Kefka: Read my lips! Mercy is
for wimps!
[NEWPAGE]
There's a reason "oppose"
rhymes with "dispose"…
If they get in your way, kill
them!
[NEWPAGE]
March!
--------------------
Elder: It seems the choice has
been made for us. Let us make
ready for war!
--------------------
Banon: They're here for the
esper…
[NEWPAGE]
Elder: We moved it up into the
cliffs above the valley.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Then that's where
we'll make our stand!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: [LOCKE] has a
complicated past… [PAUSE_01][SHORTPAUSE]
[NEWPAGE]
Don't go falling for him now,
thinking he was protecting you
out of love back there. [PAUSE_02][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[CELES]: Thanks for your
concern, but I'm a soldier, not
some love-starved twit. [PAUSE_02][SHORTPAUSE]
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: So much for my
next suggestion… [PAUSE_01][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[CELES]: [TERRA]…
Who'd have thought we'd meet
again… like this?
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: You can use magic,
too… can't you? But… it's
different from mine.
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: I was raised to be
an Imperial Magitek knight.
[NEWPAGE]
When I was still very young, I
was artificially infused with
magic.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: …Is it possible for
you to love other people?
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: …?
Are you mocking me?
--------------------
[CYAN]: Do not think even
for a moment that I trust thee!
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Fine. Use your own
eyes, and see for yourself
which side I'm on.
--------------------
[SABIN]: [EDGAR]!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: [SABIN]!
You're all right!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Who have you
brought along?
--------------------
[SABIN]: I'm going to have to
defer to my brother on this
one…
--------------------
Banon: Here they come!
--------------------
Banon: Are you ready?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
Kefka: Oh…! If it isn't General
[CELES], the traitor!
[NEWPAGE]
Excellent! Now I won't have to
hunt you down later!
--------------------
Kefka: Go!
Get those vile insects!
--------------------
Protect the esper from Kefka!
[NEWPAGE]
Would you like an explanation?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
You'll fight using 3 different
groups. Press the Y Button to
switch between them.
[NEWPAGE]
Defeat Kefka before his men
reach Banon, or the battle is
lost!
[NEWPAGE]
After you've made 3 parties on
the party formation screen,
press Start to begin the battle.
--------------------
[TERRA]: Kefka… Is he the
one who put the slave crown on
me…?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Curse the Empire!
I'm not gonna let them walk all
over people!
--------------------
[CELES]: My past is behind
me… I have nothing to do with
the Empire now!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Kefka…!
What do you hope to gain from
all this?
--------------------
[SABIN]: It's time to put
everything Master Duncan
taught me to use…
--------------------
[CYAN]: I will avenge the
people of Doma!
--------------------
[GAU]: [GAU] fight
hard!
--------------------
Banon: If they reach me, we've
lost. It's all up to you!
--------------------
Kefka: Grr!
I won't forget this!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Where's the esper?
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Is it all right?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Whew… The esper's
safe.
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: It also appears to
be… alive.
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Is that even
possible…?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: [TERRA]!
What is it!?
--------------------
[TERRA]: No!!!
--------------------
[SABIN]: [TERRA] and the
esper…!
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: They're reacting to
each other!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Uhhhn…
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Are you awake?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: … …
Where's [TERRA]!?
--------------------
[CELES]: She turned into
a… something… and flew off.
She looked like…
--------------------
[CELES]: She looked like an
esper.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: [LOCKE]!
Are you okay?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Something happened
to [TERRA]…
[NEWPAGE]
There must be some sort of
connection between her and
that esper… We need to find
her!
[NEWPAGE]
Witnesses said she went
streaking westward across the
sky, beyond Figaro.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: We've gotta hurry!
I promised I'd protect her!
--------------------
[CELES]: [LOCKE]…
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: Let's not get ahead
of ourselves. The Empire will be
back again for that esper.
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: And someone needs
to protect Banon…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Let's split up.
[NEWPAGE]
Those who aren't searching for
[TERRA] will stay here to
guard against further attacks.
[NEWPAGE]
Figaro Castle can shuttle the
others to the western province.
[NEWPAGE]
It shouldn't be hard to track
down clues in Kohlingen or
Jidoor as to [TERRA]'s
whereabouts.
--------------------
Change party members?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
[CYAN]: A former Imperial
soldier…
[NEWPAGE]
But still… We must help her!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I told [TERRA] I'd
keep her safe…
--------------------
[CELES]: When she flew off,
she almost looked like… an
esper.
--------------------
[CYAN]: Do thy best!
We must save [TERRA]!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: We're counting on
you to find [TERRA]!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Hurry and find
[TERRA]! I'll keep an eye on
things here in Narshe.
--------------------
[GAU]: [GAU] do his
best!
--------------------
[CYAN]: So, we will
infiltrate the Empire…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: The Imperial
Magitek Research Facility…
Could the secret lie within?
--------------------
[SABIN]: Leave Narshe to
me!
--------------------
[GAU]: [GAU]…
[GAU] do his best!
--------------------
Banon: Please find [TERRA]…
The future of the world rests
in her hands.
--------------------
Arvis: I heard [TERRA]
turned into a ball of light
and shot away towards the
west.
[NEWPAGE]
Perhaps someone at Figaro
Castle saw where she went.
--------------------
Elder: To be honest, I'm still not
sure what I should do… I want
to avoid war. But, on the other
hand…
--------------------
There are moogles living in a
cave deep within the mines.
--------------------
We obey the elder's will.
--------------------
Magic's real, I tell ya!
--------------------
Magic? I don't believe in that
nonsense!
--------------------
Narshe is a neutral city. We've
taken no part in the war, yet
still we are not spared from
the Empire's aggression!
--------------------
Figaro Castle can burrow
through the sand all the way
west to Kohlingen?
That's incredible!
--------------------
The house on the far right
holds all the treasures I've
collected over the years. Take
them, before the Empire does!
[NEWPAGE]
One of the boxes is locked and
won't open, though. It's too
bad… I think that one had
something good inside.
--------------------
I saw a ball of light shoot off
towards Figaro Castle. It
almost looked like… a person.
--------------------
The only thing that esper's
brought us is trouble with the
Empire. Curse the day they dug
up that freakish thing!
--------------------
It looks like war is finally upon
us…
--------------------
They say a yeti lives
somewhere inside the mines,
but who'd believe a tale like
that?
--------------------
Lone Wolf, the infamous thief,
was sighted in town recently.
I hope my treasures are safe…
--------------------
The weapon and armor shops
have started selling some new
things in preparation for the
coming war.
--------------------
Asking the espers to fight with
us? I don't know if that's such
a good idea…
--------------------
I sawr me some moogleses
playin' with one-a them big ol'
yetis the other day!
[NEWPAGE]
'Course, no one believes me…
*hic*
--------------------
This city is warmed by the heat
of our steam engines.
--------------------
Let me teach you how to ride a
chocobo!
--------------------
Press the A Button or Up to go
forward. Steer by pressing
Left or Right.
Press the B Button to dismount.
[NEWPAGE]
Careful! The bird will return to
its pen as soon as you leave the
saddle.
--------------------
100 Gil for a chocobo ride!
[NEWPAGE]
How about it?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
King [EDGAR]!
Welcome home!
--------------------
If only you could have seen the
look on Kefka's face as we
sank into the sand!
--------------------
I saw a girl blaze across the
sky like a cat on fire!
…Well, more like a flying cat on
fire, I suppose.
[NEWPAGE]
Anyway, it looked like she was
headed towards the mountains
in the west.
--------------------
Who'd have thought we'd see
the day when a human flew
over a mountain range?
Unbelievable, isn't it?
--------------------
This castle can move freely
through the sand. We can even
go under mountains if there's a
desert on the other side.
--------------------
You need to get beyond the
mountains?
[NEWPAGE]
Well, this castle can't fly over
them, but it can dive under
them. Talk to the man in charge
of the engine room.
--------------------
We've broken off our alliance
with the Empire.
--------------------
You've had a long and difficult
journey. You must be tired…
Why don't you rest for a while?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: [SABIN] should
come back here with me one
time…
--------------------
[SABIN]: Ah, this is just like
old times! I'm gonna wander
around for a bit!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Hey, wait for me!
I'm going, too!
--------------------
High Priestess: Oh, [SABIN]…
You sure have grown up,
haven't you?
[NEWPAGE]
I still remember that time, you
know. The time you really let
me have it…
[NEWPAGE]
I think you taught me
something very important that
day.
--------------------
Chancellor: Welcome home,
King [EDGAR]!
--------------------
Chancellor: [SABIN]?
My, my…! What a splendid young
man you've become!
--------------------
Chancellor: Please, take your
time and relax within the
castle!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Hmm…
Castle hasn't changed much…
--------------------
[SABIN]: And yet it's
different… Mom and Dad are
gone…
[NEWPAGE]
Nothing can ever really be the
same… Not after what
happened…
--------------------
       …tonight…
       …worst he's been…
       …so… if he should… [PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
       No…!
       Y-you're wrong!
       …It's not true! [PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
       Priestess…
       …The king, he's… [PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
       [SABIN]…
       [SABIN]…! [PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
…Dad… couldn't have… [PAUSE_04][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[SABIN]: [EDGAR]…
*sob* *sniffle*
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: So…
Dad… didn't make it…
--------------------
High Priestess: [EDGAR]!
There you are!
--------------------
High Priestess: Your father just
said he would entrust Figaro to
the two of you. Those were
his… final words.
--------------------
[SABIN]: You all make me
sick! Everyone's saying that the
Empire had Dad poisoned…
[NEWPAGE]
…and the only thing any of you
can think about is who'll be the
next king! No one's even sad!
--------------------
[SABIN]: None of you
probably cared when Mom died
after we were born, either…
[NEWPAGE]
High Priestess: That's not--
--------------------
[SABIN]: You're just as bad
as the rest of them!
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: [SABIN]…
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Empire of
murderers…! They won't get
away with this!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Let's leave this
place!
[NEWPAGE]
Let's forget this crazy
kingdom, and live our lives how
we want to!
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: You said you didn't
want to be a king, right?
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: A life of freedom,
huh…?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Priestess…
Leave us.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: …What do you
think would happen to Figaro if
both of us left?
[NEWPAGE]
There'd be no one to take the
throne. Dad was counting on us
to take care of the kingdom…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: [SABIN]…
Let's settle this with the toss
of a coin. Dad gave me this one.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: If it's heads, you
win. Tails, I win.
[NEWPAGE]
The winner chooses whichever
path he wants… no regrets, no
hard feelings. Okay?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Here we go…!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: And… you chose
your freedom.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: It's already been
ten years… That little shrimp
has grown into a whopping
lobster!
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: And you're a king
crab!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: [SABIN]…
Do you think Dad would be
proud of me?
--------------------
[SABIN]: Don't you ever
doubt that! I'm sure he's
beaming with pride, wherever
he is.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Ten years…
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Where has the
time gone…?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Here's to a couple
of confused grownups! Drink!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Here's to Dad!
--------------------
[SABIN]: To Mom!
And… to Figaro!
--------------------
Lots of requests this month!
I can take you to the desert
beyond the mountains if you'd
like.
--------------------
[CHOICE] (Go to Figaro)
[CHOICE] (Stay put)
--------------------
[CHOICE] (Go to Kohlingen)
[CHOICE] (Stay put)
--------------------
The Figaro Castle engine room
is down those stairs.
[NEWPAGE]
The engines are undergoing
maintenance so we can be
ready to move at a moment's
notice if the need arises.
--------------------
I'm sorry, I can't let you go
down there. It's too dangerous.
--------------------
Urghhh!
--------------------
Welcome to Kohlingen!
Enjoy your visit.
--------------------
Welcome to Figaro!
Enjoy your visit.
--------------------
That… [LONGPAUSE]thing! I don't know what
it was, but it tore up my house!
Some kind of glowing monster…
--------------------
A strange, glowing creature
flew through here. Scared the
living daylights out of me!
[NEWPAGE]
It took off southward, towards
Jidoor…
--------------------
I saw a pretty light! It came
here, and everyone else was
afraid of it, but… [LONGPAUSE]
I liked it!
--------------------
It's my dream to see an opera
at the opera house south of
Jidoor. With a handsome date,
of course!
[NEWPAGE]
I'd get all dolled up, put on a
sequined dress…
--------------------
Oh, [LOCKE], is that you?
Have you stopped by Rachel's
house?
--------------------
Are you a friend of
[LOCKE]'s? He always visits
Rachel's house when he's in
town…
--------------------
Best stay away from that
house on the eastern edge of
town.
[NEWPAGE]
Crazy old coot sits in there
mashing up smelly old herbs all
day… I even heard he's got a
ghost in his basement!
--------------------
My younger brother's a bit…
off. Lives alone up north, says
he's gonna build a coliseum,
or some such nonsense.
--------------------
Was that thing really a
monster? It stopped right in
front of my little girl, and I
could see it had gentle eyes…
--------------------
[SHADOW]: We meet again…
--------------------
I'm a man who has left his
name behind…
People call me…
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Leave me alone…
--------------------
People call me… [SHADOW].
--------------------
[SHADOW]: I could lend you a
hand. Just need enough to feed
my dog. Say… 3000 Gil?
[NEWPAGE]
Hire [SHADOW]?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I… [LONGPAUSE]
I couldn't protect her…
--------------------
Rachel: [LOCKE]!
What are we off to find today?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: It's almost your…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: There's supposed to
be an amazing treasure hidden
somewhere in this mountain.
[NEWPAGE]
We're gonna find it!
--------------------
Rachel: [LOCKE]!
Look out!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: RACHEL!!!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Rachel!
Are you awake?
--------------------
Rachel: … [LONGPAUSE]
…?
[NEWPAGE]
I… [LONGPAUSE]I can't remember anything…
--------------------
Rachel's Father: Get out of my
house! It's your fault Rachel
lost her memory!
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Wait! Just let me
talk to her…!
--------------------
Rachel: Please, just go away!
I don't know who you are, but
my parents get upset
whenever you come here!
--------------------
Rachel would be better off
without you hanging around,
[LOCKE]. She's going to have
to make a new start of it.
[NEWPAGE]
With you here, she can't even
do that…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: A year went by…
[NEWPAGE]
When I finally returned, I found
out that Rachel had been killed
in an Imperial attack.
[NEWPAGE]
Her memory had returned just
before she died. The last thing
she said was… [LONGPAUSE]my name.
[NEWPAGE]
I never should have left her
side. I… [LONGPAUSE]I failed her…
--------------------
A girl named Rachel used to live
in that house up there. No one
lives there anymore, though…
--------------------
Rachel… [LONGPAUSE]Her memory returned
just before she passed away.
[NEWPAGE]
She said, "If a man named
[LOCKE] returns, please tell
him that I love him…"
--------------------
I wouldn't talk to that guy if I
were you. He's an assassin.
--------------------
I'm never goin' back to Zozo!
*hic*
--------------------
We get some rather unsavory
sorts in here. That guy over
there's an assassin!
--------------------
There was an assassin sitting
at that table just a short while
ago!
--------------------
Oh, [LOCKE]! It's been a
while! Ages even!
[NEWPAGE]
Oh, that? Worry not, worry not!
Your treasure's quite safe!
Hee-hee-hee…
--------------------
Are we through here? Finished?
All done? Hee-hee-hee…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Rachel…
--------------------
It's a good thing I'd just
happened to have finished this
herbal concoction back then!
Now she'll never age a day!
[NEWPAGE]
Hee-hee-hee… Had to use my
herbs, I did! Couldn't very well
refuse with you begging me
like that…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: You're sure the
stuff will work?
--------------------
Of course, of course! The love
of your life will sleep here just
like this forever…
[NEWPAGE]
…and ever… and ever!
Hee-hee-hee…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: If there were a
way to… call her spirit back…
--------------------
A way to call her back, eh?
…You mean like that legendary
treasure? Hee-hee-hee…
[NEWPAGE]
Oh yes, I suppose if you had
that… you might be able to
bring her around!
Gwee-hee-hee-hee!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I… [LONGPAUSE]failed her…
--------------------
[CELES]: [LOCKE]…
--------------------
That? Oh, that's [LOCKE]'s…
…Dear me, I almost spilled the
beans! Hee-hee-hee…
--------------------
This is Jidoor, the westernmost
town on the world map!
--------------------
The class divide is quite visible
here. All of the middle-class
families live in the southern
part of town.
[NEWPAGE]
The richer folks live up in the
north. You can see one of their
enormous mansions from here!
--------------------
All the poor people were forced
out of town. I hear they built a
new town in the valley between
the mountains up north.
--------------------
Maria, the famous opera diva,
is absolutely gorgeous!
--------------------
I'm gonna be an opera singer
when I grow up!
[NEWPAGE]
Huh? You don't know where the
opera house is? It's waaay
south of here!
--------------------
I saw a girl bathed in light
speed off toward the northern
mountains…
--------------------
The town of Zozo is nestled
between the mountains to the
north. It's a den of thieves and
ne'er-do-wells.
--------------------
Those folks in Zozo don't have
an ounce of honesty among the
lot of them… Don't trust a word
they say!
--------------------
Oops! Sorry.
--------------------
Every once in a while one of
those shady kids from Zozo
wanders down here, looking
for an easy mark. Be careful.
--------------------
You're obviously not from
around here… Straighten your
back! Don't slump so much!
--------------------
Oh, are you an art admirer too?
…No? How utterly uncivilized!
--------------------
Some truly valuable works of
art can be had at this auction
house. Probably not by the likes
of you, though!
--------------------
I want one of those legendary
treasures that bring back
departed souls! None of the
other rich folks have one yet…
[NEWPAGE]
I've heard you can get one in
the Imperial capital of Vector…
--------------------
Zozo? Never heard of it!
--------------------
Great people here! You can
trust everything they say!
--------------------
Lovely weather we're having!
--------------------
It's 2:00.
--------------------
Time, you say? It's 4:00.
--------------------
Don't listen to the others!
Trust me, it's 8:00!
--------------------
Oh, it's 10:00! I'd better be
getting home.
--------------------
It's already 12:00.
--------------------
A girl? Nope, haven't seen any
girls lately.
[NEWPAGE]
And there's definitely not one
on the top floor of this
building, so don't bother
checking.

"Did you say… flew? That

Well, I'd stay away from the

My watch's second hand is

If you climb to the top of the

Hey, no cutting! Get in line!

I didn't mean to be in the way!

I'm not very strong in a fight

all right?

[GAU]: [TERRA]… she
okay?
--------------------
Ramuh: So, her name is
[TERRA]…? Interesting…!

Ramuh: Her life is in no danger.
She simply used a power she
didn't know she had, and it
overwhelmed her.
[NEWPAGE]
Now her body won't listen to
what she's telling it to do.
[NEWPAGE]
As for myself, I am Ramuh, the

You're an esper!?

Don't espers live in another

[CELES]: But don't espers
live in another world?

[GAU]: Espers… live other

Ramuh: That doesn't mean
there's anything stopping us
from living in this one.
[NEWPAGE]
Espers come in a variety of
forms. My appearance is similar
to your own, so I can live here
as one of you…
[NEWPAGE]
…without fear of anyone
discovering the truth.
--------------------
Why hide the fact that you're
an esper?
--------------------
[GAU]: Why you not tell
people you esper?
--------------------
Ramuh: Humans and espers are
incompatible creatures.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: But my grandma
told me that humans and espers
once lived side by side…
[NEWPAGE]
Of course, that was only a
bedtime story…
--------------------
My grandmother told me that
humans and espers used to live
here together, side by side…
[NEWPAGE]
Of course, that was only a
bedtime story…
--------------------
I've heard that long ago,
humans and espers lived side
by side in this world.
[NEWPAGE]
I'd always thought it was just
a fairy tale, but…
--------------------
[GAU]: [GAU] hear
fairy tale… People… espers…
before, live same place!
--------------------
Ramuh: No, that was no fairy
tale. That was the truth.
Humans and espers used to live
together in harmony.
[NEWPAGE]
At least… until the War of the
Magi.
--------------------
Until the War of the Magi…?
--------------------
Ramuh: It took place long ago…
[NEWPAGE]
Espers fought humans who had
been infused with magical
powers extracted from other
espers.
--------------------
After the meaningless war had
ended, the espers fashioned a
new realm to which they exiled
themselves.
[NEWPAGE]
They feared that if they
remained, it would only be a
matter of time before their
powers were targeted again.
--------------------
But then one day about twenty
years ago, humans stumbled
upon the entrance to that
hidden realm…
[NEWPAGE]
Humans who knew of espers
and the secrets of our powers. [PAUSE_08][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
Gestahl, the leader of the men,
knew that he could use the
powers extracted from us to
create an invincible army.
[NEWPAGE]
And thus began the hunt. [PAUSE_08][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
As soon as we realized what
was happening, we erected a
massive gate and forced the
humans out.
--------------------
Ramuh: Those who were caught
are now in the Empire's Magitek
Research Facility, being drained
of their powers.
[NEWPAGE]
I narrowly escaped that same
fate, and now I am here with
you.
--------------------
Ramuh: She seems to have
calmed down a bit…
--------------------
Ramuh: I called [TERRA] here
to me when I sensed that she
had lost control. She responded
to that call.
--------------------
So [TERRA]'s… an esper?
--------------------
Ramuh: No, she's a bit different
from us…
--------------------
She looks like she's in pain…
[NEWPAGE]
Ramuh: She is afraid of what
she is, and that is a painful
thing.
--------------------
What can we do to help her?
--------------------
Ramuh: Once she understands
her true nature, the fear and
doubt should subside.
--------------------
Is there nothing we can do?
[NEWPAGE]
Ramuh: The others of my kind
who are trapped in Gestahl's
Magitek Research Facility may
be able to help her.
--------------------
And if we can get inside that
facility, you're sure we'll find
them?
--------------------
[CELES]: …Huh? The Magitek
Research Facility? Your people
are in there!?
--------------------
[GAU]: Ma-gi-tek
Re-search Fa… ci-luh-tee?
…Your friends there?
--------------------
[CELES]: …The Magitek
Research Facility? Your people
are in there?
--------------------
Ramuh: I escaped alone,
abandoning my friends and
hiding here like a coward.
[NEWPAGE]
But I fear I can remain here no
longer.
--------------------
What do you mean?
--------------------
Ramuh: Gestahl's methods are
mistaken. You can't drain an
esper's powers by force. That
weakens them.
[NEWPAGE]
Only when we become magicite
can our powers be transferred
in full.
--------------------
What are you saying?
[NEWPAGE]
Ramuh: I am going to turn
myself into magicite so that I
may lend you my strength.
[NEWPAGE]
Magicite…?
[NEWPAGE]
Ramuh: Magicite is an esper's
power in its purest form. When
an esper dies, magicite is all
that is left behind…
[NEWPAGE]
But…!
--------------------
Ramuh: These are my
companions who fell as we fled
the Empire… And I will give you
my power as well…
--------------------
Why would you do such a
thing…?
--------------------
Ramuh: If our power is used
for destruction, the skies will
darken and life will fade from
the earth…
[NEWPAGE]
You must stop them. There
must not be a second War of
the Magi…
--------------------
Old man… You're really gone,
aren't you…?
--------------------
[SHADOW]: You old fool…
Why throw it all away…?
--------------------
[CYAN]: He's… gone, isn't
he?
--------------------
[CELES]: Ramuh…
Why…?
--------------------
[GAU]: Ra… muh…
You leave… not come back?
--------------------
He turned himself to magicite…
--------------------
He gave up his life to help us…
--------------------
[CYAN]: He sacrificed
himself to give us the strength
with which to fight the Empire…
--------------------
[CELES]: He gave up his own
life so that we'd have the
power to stop them…
--------------------
[GAU]: Waoooh…
--------------------
[TERRA]… Just hold on.
We'll be back for you!

Everyone's here? I was just

[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: Let's talk on the
way back down!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: So, the Empire's
been draining magic from
espers… [PAUSE_06][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[SABIN]: [CELES], was
all of that true? [PAUSE_06][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[CELES]: I was asleep when
they performed my infusion,
so I don't know for sure.
[NEWPAGE]
But… I've heard rumors to that
effect.
--------------------
[CYAN]: Then I suppose we
must find a way to slip into the
Empire…
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: We'd best split up
again. We still need to beef up
our defenses in Narshe.
--------------------
[CYAN]: That would indeed
be wise.
--------------------
[CELES]: I'll go to the
Empire. I know it inside and
out.
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: But alone…?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Don't worry. I'll go
with her.
--------------------
[CELES]: [LOCKE]!
--------------------
[CYAN]: It may not hurt to
have a few more people along.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Wait for us back in
Narshe. Don't worry, we'll be
fine!
[NEWPAGE]
If we need to change party
members, I guess we'll just
head back to Narshe…
--------------------
[SHADOW]: I can't remain with
you any longer.
--------------------
[CELES]: So… how are we
going to get there? The
Empire's on the southern
continent…
[NEWPAGE]
They've closed down all the
harbors, so there aren't even
any ships sailing there
anymore.
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: The town of Jidoor
to the south is full of wealthy
aristocrats…
[NEWPAGE]
One of them might know a way
in. It's like they say, "Where
there's a Gil…"
--------------------
[CELES]: [LOCKE].
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Yeah?
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Why are you coming
with me?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Hmm? Well… there's
the rumor about that legendary
treasure being there and all…
[NEWPAGE]
…I just wanted to have a look
around.
--------------------
No one would be crazy enough
to go to the Imperial continent
these days unless they had no
choice.
--------------------
The only way to reach the
Empire now is by air. Of course,
you'd need an airship for that.
[NEWPAGE]
…What, did you think I was
going to suggest launching
yourself from a catapult?
Are you daft?
--------------------
There's only one working
airship in the world. It's owned
by the Gambler. They say he
uses it as a flying pirate ship…
--------------------
The Gambler always conducts
his business with pomp and
pageantry.
[NEWPAGE]
He's also a big fan of the
opera. Of course, I heard he
only goes there to see the
leading lady…
--------------------
You're the spitting image of
Maria! Huh? Haven't heard of
her, you say? She's a famous
opera singer!
--------------------
Impresario: Maria…!?
--------------------
[CELES]: …M-me?
--------------------
Impresario: Sorry, I mistook
you for someone else.
Wow, you could pass for Maria
in a heartbeat!
[NEWPAGE]
…Oh dear, we're really in
trouble this time…
--------------------
[CELES] looks like Maria…?
--------------------
That man must've dropped
this…
--------------------
Maestro: That man is the
director of the troupe that
performs at the opera house.
[NEWPAGE]
Everyone just calls him
"Impresario". He's been in a
tizzy ever since that letter
arrived.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Who's this
"Wandering What's-His-Face"?
[NEWPAGE]
Maestro: Were you born on a
farm, son?
--------------------
That would be [SETZER],
owner of the world's only
airship!
--------------------
A gambling vagabond who finds
freedom from society's narrow
views of morality aboard his
airship, the Blackjack…
--------------------
"Dearest Maria, I've decided to
[SPACE_07]take you as my wife, so I'll
[SPACE_07]be coming to kidnap you.
[SPACE_20]- The Wandering Gambler"
--------------------
[CELES]: If we had that
airship, we'd have our way into
the Empire…
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Let's set up a
meeting with this [SETZER].
--------------------
The opera house is closed.
--------------------
There's a performance
underway.
--------------------
Impresario: Ah! It's you again!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: We read that letter.
So, [SETZER] is coming to
snatch Maria away…
[NEWPAGE]
Impresario: He'll probably
appear right at the climax of
the first act. He loves to make
an entrance… *sigh*
--------------------
[LOCKE]: All right!
When he shows up, we'll jump
out and nab him!
--------------------
Impresario: Dear me, no! You'll
ruin the performance! I'll lose
my job!
--------------------
[CELES]: But if you don't do
anything…!
[NEWPAGE]
Impresario: Oh, this is simply
horrible! I want the show to be
a success… but I don't want
Maria to be abducted!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Let him grab her.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: We'll use a decoy.
Once he's got her, we'll follow
him right back to his airship.
[NEWPAGE]
And if all goes well, we should
be able to commandeer it!
--------------------
Impresario: Are you mad!? If
anything should happen to
Maria…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: That's why we use
the decoy! We can hide Maria
someplace safe!
[NEWPAGE]
Impresario: Come again?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: You said that
[CELES] looks like Maria,
right?
--------------------
[CELES]: Now just a minute…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: She can be our
Maria! We'll let [SETZER]
kidnap her and lead us to his
airship!
--------------------
Impresario: Brilliant!
--------------------
[CELES]: H-hold on here!
I'm a former general, not some
opera floozy!
--------------------
Mi… [LONGPAUSE]Mi… [LONGPAUSE]
Do, re, mi…

y'all, just like [SETZER]!
It'll be TONS of fun!

you, [CELES]!

[CELES]: But I have some
conditions…
--------------------
We flip this coin. If it's heads,
you help us. If it's tails, I'm
yours.
[NEWPAGE]
Well, Mr. Gambler?
--------------------
[SETZER]: Ha! I like it!
I accept.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: [CELES]…
Are you serious…?
If you marry that guy…
--------------------
[CYAN]: There is no telling
what manner of dishonorable
things he might do to thee…
--------------------
[CELES]: Ready?
--------------------
[CELES]: Heads… I win.
Now it's time for you to hold up
your end of the bargain.
--------------------
[SETZER]: …A valuable trinket
indeed. I've never seen a
double-headed coin before.
--------------------
[CELES]: I'm afraid you've
been hustled, Mr. Gambler.
But that's part of the game,
now, isn't it?
--------------------
[SETZER]: Ha! How low can
you stoop? [LONGPAUSE]…I love it!
All right, I'll help you.

--------------------
[LOCKE]: They'll spot us in

[NEWPAGE]
We'd better land a safe

[SETZER]: That sounds like a

[NEWPAGE]

--------------------
[SETZER]: What's the matter?
Lost your nerve to take on the
Empire?
--------------------
[SETZER]: I need to repair the
airship. Please, hurry and check
out the situation in the Empire!
--------------------
[SETZER]: The repairs will
take some time. You're going to
have to take a boat from
Albrook.
--------------------
[SETZER]: Oh! [LONGPAUSE]
By all means, take a turn at the

--------------------
[EDGAR]: I don't like the

[SABIN]: Whoa!

[GAU]: Uwao! Waou!!!

[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No

--------------------
Hey, that's cool, I don't judge!
Wanna hear something juicy?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
All the soldiers at the Magitek
Research Facility can use magic
now. All thanks to that genius,
Cid, apparently…
--------------------
Here's another one for you… [LONGPAUSE]
That Kefka guy? They say he
was one of Cid's first
experimental Magitek knights.
[NEWPAGE]
The process hadn't been
perfected yet. Kefka ended up
with incredible magic power,
but it shattered his mind…
--------------------
General Leo's never had a
Magitek infusion. He's a
warrior's warrior!
--------------------
I heard General [CELES]
went over to the Returners…
Why join the side that has no
hope of winning?
--------------------
Your friends are in the pub.
--------------------
Banon: What happened here…?
[NEWPAGE]
…!
Did the espers do this!? No,
they couldn't have…!
--------------------
Arvis: It was like this when we
got here.
--------------------
Returner: What in the world
happened…?
--------------------
Banon: So, that's what Gestahl
said… Team up with the Empire
to look for the espers… [LONGPAUSE]Hmm…
--------------------
Arvis: It does make sense…
We can't just leave the espers
alone.
--------------------
Returner: The war… It's really
over…
--------------------
Narshe Guard: We didn't have to
do a thing. It looks like the
Empire destroyed itself for us.
--------------------
Narshe Guard: What's going
on…?
--------------------
Wonder if those rumors about
them extracting magic from
monsters at the research
facility are true?
--------------------
Shhh! I'm a Returner. I've heard
all about you.
--------------------
I'll distract the soldiers. Use
this box to climb up onto those
steel beams and sneak into the
research facility.
--------------------
Are you ready?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No

Young folks… Please, don't give

That was close…
--------------------
Soldier: Filthy Returner scum!
--------------------
I think I'm going to stay here
and apply to become a soldier…
--------------------
In the same army that
destroyed our village? What

over in Maranda?
--------------------
Stay the night! It's on the

[CHOICE] Okay
[CHOICE] No thanks…

1000 Gil was stolen!

Nee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

Kefka: I'm a god!
I'm all-powerful!
Uwee-hee-hee…
[NEWPAGE]
I'll collect more espers…
I'll extract their magic…
[NEWPAGE]
And then… [LONGPAUSE]… [LONGPAUSE]… [LONGPAUSE]
I'll revive the Warring Triad!
--------------------
Kefka: I've already drained all
your powers! You're useless to
me now!
--------------------
Kefka: You too! Take a hike!
--------------------
Ifrit: Hmmm…
[NEWPAGE]
Shiva: I can see why Ramuh
entrusted you with his power…
--------------------
Ifrit: Gestahl has captured
many more of us. They're all
here, being drained of their
powers.
[NEWPAGE]
I, too, suffered my turn in one
of the capsules…
--------------------
Shiva: When they finish draining
us of our powers, they dump us
down here to die. We haven't
much time left…
--------------------
We and Ramuh were siblings,
each of us born with a
different elemental power.
[NEWPAGE]
If Ramuh was willing to give
you his strength, then we shall
do the same…
--------------------
Our friends are also…
running out of time…
[NEWPAGE]
I'm sure they will lend you
their strength as well…

--------------------
Cid: What are you doing over
there?
--------------------
Cid: Wh-what are those!?
--------------------
Cid: So… when espers die, they
can leave behind the essence of
their powers…

The power contained within
these stones is far greater

to extract…

Hundreds of times greater…

That blast reversed the energy

Cid: Quick! Over here!

Cid: Oh, what have I done…?
[NEWPAGE]
There's no excuse for it, no

have threatened me…

Cid: Draining the life energy
from espers just to make
people stronger…
--------------------
Cid: You've helped me come to a

I'm going to talk to the
emperor and make him realize
how foolish this whole war is!
--------------------
Cid: [CELES]…
[NEWPAGE]
I've known her ever since she
was a child. I doted on her as if
she were my own daughter.
[NEWPAGE]
But I also forced her to become
a Magitek knight…

If I ever get to see her again, I
want to apologize… for all of
my mistakes…

Cid: Oh no! It's Kefka!

Wait, is this a…?
[NEWPAGE]
[CHOICE] (Return with her)
[CHOICE] (Leave her here)
--------------------
She's still quite weak… She'll
need to rest for a while.
--------------------
Elder: She's a human?
[NEWPAGE]
Maduin: She must have
wandered in from the other
realm by mistake.
--------------------
Elder: There's an ominous air
about this evening…
--------------------
Good evening, Maduin!
--------------------
We ought to kill it right away.
Humans and espers are
incompatible…
--------------------
Is it your turn to watch the
gate, Maduin?
--------------------
Everyone is worried…
--------------------
Wouldn't you love to see the
human realm beyond the
northern gate just once,
Maduin?
--------------------
Why'd you bring that thing
here?
--------------------
This is one nasty storm…
Be careful, Maduin.
--------------------
The barrier between our
realms must've weakened over
the past millennium.
--------------------
Hey, Maduin! How have you
been?
--------------------
Do you have any idea what
you've done?
--------------------
Elder's orders… No one passes
through the gate.
--------------------
Maduin! Someone's trying to
come through the gate!
--------------------
I heard there's a human girl in
the village!
--------------------
…
--------------------
…
--------------------
Maduin: Did I wake you?
--------------------
Young Woman: You're… an
esper? What's this pendant
around your neck?
--------------------
Maduin: …I'll give it to you.
A charm from the Esper Realm!
[NEWPAGE]
Young Woman: The Esper
Realm… So, that is where I
ended up…
[NEWPAGE]
Maduin: Everyone is at a loss as
to how you, a human, could
have made it into our realm…
[NEWPAGE]
Young Woman: You're the one
who saved me, right?
--------------------
Madeline: My name is Madeline.
I was sick of living in the
human realm. It's nothing but a
vortex of greed and hate…
[NEWPAGE]
So I wandered out into the
storm, and before I knew it, I
was here…
--------------------
Maduin: They say that humans
and espers… can't coexist.
--------------------
Madeline: So… you don't want
me here, right?
[NEWPAGE]
Maduin: No, I'm just… not sure.
--------------------
Madeline: I'll return to my own
realm tomorrow.
[NEWPAGE]
Maduin: All right… Someone can
show you the way back.
--------------------
Elder: That human already left.
I wonder if she'll be all right
without a guide?
--------------------
If the humans learned of our
powers and decided to try to
make use of them… That would
be a terrible thing indeed.
--------------------
That human girl went to the
gate quite a while ago.
--------------------
For centuries, no human has
wandered into our realm. Why
has this happened now, after
all these years?
--------------------
Youth: What's wrong, Maduin?
--------------------
Maduin: If you don't want to go
back to your realm, you're
welcome to stay here.
[NEWPAGE]
Madeline: But… Humans and
espers can't be together…
--------------------
Maduin: How can we know for
sure unless we try for
ourselves?
--------------------
How can we know for sure…
--------------------
unless we…
--------------------
try for ourselves…?
--------------------
Maduin: I've chosen a name for
her…
[NEWPAGE]
Madeline: What is it?
[NEWPAGE]
Maduin: "[TERRA]".
It's beautiful, isn't it?
--------------------
Two years later…
--------------------
Humans!
[NEWPAGE]
The nexus between our realms
has opened again! This storm is
just like the one two years
ago…
--------------------
But this is different from the
time Madeline came here… This
time, an army has come
seeking our magical powers.
--------------------
This is no good! Retreat to the
elder's house!
--------------------
Gestahl: Aha!
I've finally found it.
[NEWPAGE]
After all that time spent
decoding the secrets of those
ancient texts…
[NEWPAGE]
Now it's time to reap the
rewards!
--------------------
Gestahl: Grab them! Riches to
any man who captures an
esper! GO!
--------------------
Elder: We've no choice… We
must do what we've been
avoiding…
[NEWPAGE]
Maduin: You mean… the magic
barrier?
--------------------
It's dangerous out there!
--------------------
It won't be long before the
humans make it here…
--------------------
Madeline: [TERRA]'s all right.
--------------------
Elder: I'll create a tempest to
sweep all the invaders out of
our realm, then I'll seal the
gate.
[NEWPAGE]
Even among espers, the power
to create a magical seal is
limited to a single bloodline.
I am the last of that line…
--------------------
Maduin: But at your age…
[NEWPAGE]
Elder: …I may not survive. And
without me, you will never
again be able to open the gate.
[NEWPAGE]
Maduin: Madeline…
--------------------
Madeline: The other realm holds
nothing for me.
--------------------
Elder: Then it's decided. We
have no other choice.
--------------------
Esper: This is all because of
that human woman!
[NEWPAGE]
Maduin: Nonsense!
[NEWPAGE]
Esper: She could have led them
here for all we know!
--------------------
Maduin: Enough!
[NEWPAGE]
Esper: No! She's one of them!
It'll only be a matter of time
before she decides she wants
our power, too!
--------------------
Maduin: Oh, no…!
--------------------
Madeline took [TERRA] and
left!
--------------------
Elder: Where are you going!?
[NEWPAGE]
Maduin: Madeline, she…!
[NEWPAGE]
Elder: Oh, no… But it's already
too late! I've begun activating
the seal. You won't be able to
return!
[NEWPAGE]
Maduin: I don't care!
--------------------
Maduin: Madeline!
--------------------
[TERRA]!!!

Madeline: Maduin…
I'm not like them…
[NEWPAGE]
Maduin: I know!

home with me?

ultimate treasure was within
my grasp!

[NEWPAGE]
Gestahl: Your daughter? Hmm…
Then she must be half human
and half… [LONGPAUSE]How fascinating!
[NEWPAGE]
Gestahl: Mwa-ha-ha!
[NEWPAGE]
It looks like my dreams of
building an empire may come
true sooner than I'd ever
imagined!

Gestahl: This realm will be mine

[TERRA]: I'm the daughter of
an esper and a human… That's
why I have these abilities…
[NEWPAGE]
But I should be okay now. I can
control this power, as long as I
only use it in short bursts.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Gestahl already
knew the secret of the espers'
power back then…
[NEWPAGE]

comes home safe…
--------------------
These soldiers are out of
control, and there's nothing we
can do about it. How long do we
have to put up with this?
--------------------
Tzen and Albrook were invaded
by the Empire, too.
--------------------
Rooms are 200 Gil per night.
Will you be staying?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
Heh-heh… We can do anything
we want in this town!
--------------------
We must begin rebuilding!
--------------------
My son has returned! I was so
worried when they forced him
into the Imperial army…
--------------------
The soldiers left our town as
soon as the peace agreement
was reached.
--------------------
The Imperial troops are gone!
Now I can go back to dancing
and raking in the Gil!
--------------------
I was forced to become a
soldier in the Imperial army.
I can't believe the awful things
they made me do…
--------------------
I kind of miss that soldier now
that he's gone…
--------------------
Most of the town's youths were
led off to serve in the Imperial
army.
--------------------
All of those young people who
were forced to join the
Imperial army should be
coming back home soon.
--------------------
Sleep magic has the power to
interrupt prayer. Or at least
that's what I once heard…
--------------------
It's time to put Tzen back
together!
--------------------
Our royal family was
slaughtered by the Empire.
--------------------
Thanks to you, we're finally at
peace with the Empire!
--------------------
I'll tell you a secret… The
Empire has a weapon called the
Guardian. It's immobile, but
ridiculously powerful.
[NEWPAGE]
If you ever see it, run away
and don't look back!
--------------------
Now we should be able to enjoy
another long age of peace!
--------------------
Mom says I'm not s'posed to
play outside 'cause it's
dangerous!
--------------------
Yay! I'm allowed to play outside
again!
--------------------
Where's that boy of mine? I
told him not to play outside!
It's dangerous with all these
soldiers around…
--------------------
The Imperial troops are gone.
Now we can relax and get back
to our normal lives.
--------------------
Uh-oh…! [LONGPAUSE]
Whew… don't scare people like
that! I thought you were an
Imperial trooper!
[NEWPAGE]
Not too long ago, some people
broke into the Magitek
Research Facility and raised a
huge ruckus.
[NEWPAGE]
I used the opportunity to sneak
in and grab this glowing stone.
For 3000 Gil, it's yours!
[NEWPAGE]
[CHOICE] (Buy glowing stone)
[CHOICE] (Don't buy it)
--------------------
With the world falling apart
like it is, I guess it doesn't do
me much good to hold on to this
glowing stone…
[NEWPAGE]
Look, how's 10 Gil sound for this
thing?
[CHOICE] (Buy it)
[CHOICE] (Don't buy it)
--------------------
Haven't heard any juicy gossip,
have you?
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Seraph magicite!
--------------------
Anyone who opposes the will of
the Empire will be strung up
for treason!
--------------------
Obey the Empire!
--------------------
Shove off! Can't you see I'm
busy?
--------------------
This town belongs to the
Empire!
--------------------
Defy us and you'll regret it!
--------------------
Rooms are 350 Gil per night.
Will you be staying?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
Welcome to Albrook, the
occupied city…
--------------------
They said they would be
reopening the harbor soon.
Some life should start flowing
back into this town now.
--------------------
Where in the world did that
floating island in the sky come
from!?
--------------------
There's something important on
the eastern edge of the
continent…
[NEWPAGE]
The Imperials built an
observation post there and
won't let anyone beyond it.
--------------------
I heard monsters flew out of
the mountains behind the
Imperial observation post and
attacked Vector!
--------------------
Yeah, this is what we get,
thanks to that big, floating
island up there blotting out the
sun. Lovely, ain't it?
--------------------
We have to bribe the Imperial
soldiers or they won't let us do
business here… In our own city!
*sob*
--------------------
"I've got nothing to sell to
[SPACE_07]Imperial scum!"
[NEWPAGE]
Sorry, I've just wanted to say
that for so long!
--------------------
Now it's us bribing them to let
us do business here… *sob*
--------------------
They say there's no one left in
the Empire, and now there's an
island floating in the sky…
[NEWPAGE]
I've got a bad feeling about
this…
--------------------
The Imperial capital of Vector
is right at the center of this
continent.
--------------------
You can find excellent weapons
and armor in the shops in Tzen,
to the north, and Maranda, to
the west.
--------------------
A guy came here trying to sell
me some strange, glowing
stone… When I didn't buy it, he
told me he was going to Tzen.
--------------------
I study monsters. The ones on
this continent seem to be
exceptionally vulnerable to
magic…
--------------------
I found this passage in an
ancient text from a thousand
years ago…
[NEWPAGE]
[CENTER]The Dragon Lord Bahamut…
[CENTER]On the fall of his fellows eight,
[CENTER]his rise will test thine fate…
--------------------
I'm a scholar of ancient
weaponry.
[NEWPAGE]
Two weapons known as Atma
Weapons were used during the
War of the Magi a thousand
years ago.
[NEWPAGE]
One was a sword whose blade
sprang from its wielder's
strength. The other was a
monster born for destruction.
--------------------
The port's off-limits!
--------------------
Welcome! Tee-hee-hee!
--------------------
Hey, you're not an Imperial!
Get out of here!
--------------------
You probably don't even have
any money!
--------------------
*hic*
I shink I've hadda bit too druch
to mink…
--------------------
Who would've thought we'd end
up allied with the Returners?
--------------------
Now we can all live in peace
again.
--------------------
I couldn't believe it when I
heard the news that espers had
attacked the Empire…
--------------------
Nothing out of the ordinary to
report! All's well!
--------------------
So the war's finally over…
--------------------
Sheesh… Those soldiers think
they own this place!
--------------------
This pub's pretty much an
Imperial clubhouse these days.
--------------------
Business has gone down the
drain with all the soldiers
gone…
[NEWPAGE]
…
Oops, better watch what I say.
Wouldn't want anyone
questioning my loyalties!
--------------------
Yeah, baby! Wh-whew!
--------------------
Rooms are 300 Gil per night.

[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No

General Leo already made
arrangements for your stay
here tonight. By all means…

Rooms are 100 Gil per night.
Will you be staying?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
We've been waiting for you.
Please follow me…
--------------------
Banon: Oh, you're here! The
people of Narshe have finally
decided to fight the Empire.
[NEWPAGE]
How did things go in Vector?
--------------------
Arvis: I see… We'd been trying
to work out a plan to make use
of Narshe's resources and
Figaro's machinery, but…
[NEWPAGE]
…We just don't have enough
troops to storm the Empire.
--------------------
Banon: We have to open the
Sealed Gate…
--------------------
[TERRA]: …The gate to the
Esper Realm?
--------------------
Arvis: We'll never beat the
Empire without their help.
--------------------
Banon: The Sealed Gate lies to
the Empire's east.
[NEWPAGE]
When we open it, the espers
can attack from there while we
launch an invasion from the
north.
--------------------
Banon: We must reestablish the
bond of trust that once existed
between humans and espers.
[NEWPAGE]
The espers must be made to
understand. And there is only
one among us who can make
them…
--------------------
If humans and espers
were truly incompatible…
I would never have been born…
--------------------
[TERRA]: …
--------------------
[TERRA]: I'll do it.
I'm the only one who can!
--------------------
[TERRA]!
--------------------
An attack on two fronts…
--------------------
Banon: What is it? Did you learn
anything new?
--------------------
Banon: If we can get the espers
to understand, we can put an
end to this war once and for
all.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]…
I know you can do it…
--------------------
Esper: I am the Mist Dragon…
I shall now test your strength.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: The Sealed Gate…
Are you feeling anything,
[TERRA]?
--------------------
[TERRA]: …
--------------------
[LOCKE]: [TERRA]…
--------------------
The espers wouldn't give us the
time of day without
[TERRA]… We'd better bring
her along.
--------------------
[TERRA]: …I know I can do
this, but still… I really don't
want to go there all alone…
--------------------
That's odd… There aren't any
guards…
--------------------
The party was thrown out…
--------------------
[TERRA]: We shouldn't stand
around… Let's go.
--------------------
[TERRA]: …
--------------------
This is the Sealed Gate…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Beyond there is the
Esper Realm…
--------------------
[CYAN]: What an eerie
place…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: From here on out,
it's all up to you, [TERRA]…
--------------------
[SABIN]: We're counting on
you, [TERRA]…
--------------------
[SETZER]: Oh, what am I doing
in a dreadful place like this…?
--------------------
[TERRA]: Espers…
Heed my call…
--------------------
Uwa-ha-ha!
--------------------
Kefka: Emperor Gestahl was
right!
--------------------
[TERRA], quickly! [LONGPAUSE]
The gate!
--------------------
Wh-what!?
--------------------
Espers!?
--------------------
The gate…!
--------------------
…Where did the espers go?
--------------------
[TERRA]: We'd better head
back to the airship.
--------------------
Kefka: Grr… Curse you!
I won't forget this!
--------------------
"What just happened…?"
[NEWPAGE]
"I'm not sure…"
--------------------
We should hurry back to the
airship.
--------------------

--------------------
[TERRA]: Don't worry. I'm
sure a peaceful future is right
around the corner!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: We'll bring peace
back to the world… no matter
what!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: The espers probably
headed straight for Vector…
--------------------
[CYAN]: I cannot forgive the
Empire…
--------------------
[CYAN]: I could feel the
warrior spirit in those espers.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: …
…Why am I here? For the
money. [LONGPAUSE]
…Right?
--------------------
[SHADOW]: This is just
between us, but I heard that
Kefka has designs on General
Leo's life…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: I'm not just sitting
here playing games! …I'm
thinking up our next strategy!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Somehow we need
to convince the espers to lend
us their aid…
--------------------
[SABIN]: Let me at the
Empire!
--------------------
[SABIN]: We should hurry
and check out the situation in
the Empire. I'm a little
worried…
--------------------
[CELES]: I may have served
as a general to the Empire, but
I still know evil when I see it.
--------------------
[CELES]: I'm sure Kefka has
some dirty plan up his sleeve.
We need to act fast…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: I traveled around
the world, too, in my younger
days…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Never in all my
years have I fallen from
anywhere so high up!
--------------------
[RELM]: Hey!
Do you want me to paint your
portrait?
--------------------
[RELM]: Those espers are all
friendly, right!?
--------------------
[SETZER]: What's important to
me…? Bah! If I were attached
to things, I couldn't gamble!
--------------------
[SETZER]: Blast it…
I guess the skies'll have to
wait…

[MOG]: Kupoppo!

[UMARO]: Ooga…

[TERRA]: The espers…
They were… angry…
--------------------
What happened?
--------------------
The espers all flew off
together…
--------------------
The Imperials all ran off, too,
as if they were afraid of
something…
--------------------
Which way did the espers go?
--------------------
Toward the Imperial capital…
--------------------
There's something buried here…
--------------------
…Vector.
--------------------
[SETZER]: We're almost to
Vector.
--------------------
Huh? What's that…!?
--------------------
There's a switch inside the
chest.
[CHOICE] (Flick the switch)
[CHOICE] (Leave it alone)

The emperor is expecting you.
This way, please…
--------------------
Emperor Gestahl is waiting for
you.
--------------------
The espers that came out of
that gate tore the Empire to
shreds…
--------------------
I've lost the will to fight…
--------------------
The emperor imprisoned Kefka
after he learned about
everything he'd done.
[NEWPAGE]
It sounds like Kefka may end
up spending the rest of his life
behind bars…
--------------------
The war's over…
--------------------
The power of those espers…
It's simply terrifying…
--------------------
I wonder if the espers came to
rescue their friends…?
--------------------
Peace, huh…?
--------------------
The Magitek Research Facility's
been shut down.
--------------------
Hey! How'd you get back there!?
--------------------
The emperor said he's going to
begin peace talks with the
Returners, and with other
nations.
--------------------
Kefka's been locked up. I heard
it's because the emperor found
out he used poison against the
people of Doma.
--------------------
Using poison… How low can you
go? I've always hated Kefka!
--------------------
Kefka: Gah!
How dare they put me in a
place like this! …Hmph!
--------------------
Kefka: I just can't believe it!
--------------------
Kefka: What a bore.
--------------------
Kefka's scum. It serves him
right!
--------------------
I lost my whole family in the
war…
--------------------
The war ended before I even
got a chance to use this thing…
--------------------
Kefka's been thrown in jail.
--------------------
Gestahl: I've lost my will to
fight…
--------------------
Cid: The emperor's had a
change of heart…
--------------------
Cid!
--------------------
Cid: The espers came to save
their friends…
[NEWPAGE]
When they learned that none of
them were alive, they ravaged
the entire city…
[NEWPAGE]
I'll never forget their shrieks
of rage…
--------------------
Soldier: We're hanging up our
weapons for good. The war is
over.
--------------------
Gestahl: The power of those
espers… I had no idea.
[NEWPAGE]
They'll destroy the entire world
if we don't do something. We're
utterly helpless against them.
[NEWPAGE]
We must find a way to calm
their rage.
--------------------
Cid: Men should never lust after
power they lack the means to
control…
--------------------
Gestahl: Friends! Let us speak
more over dinner tonight!
--------------------
Cid: There are still some
soldiers who'd prefer to keep
fighting.
[NEWPAGE]
Please, talk to as many as you
can before dinner. Make them
understand!
--------------------
Dinner preparations are
underway. Please wait just a
bit longer.
--------------------
Soldier: You have 4 minutes
until dinner. Please talk to as

Only that chest in the back

Emperor Gestahl commissioned
a painting, but what kind of
painting should I do…?
--------------------
I finished the emperor's
painting. I ended up turning it
into a portrait.
[NEWPAGE]
I have no idea why he didn't
like it… I even painted that
thing he originally asked for in
the background!
[NEWPAGE]
Anyway, I sure didn't need a
painting of the emperor, so I
sold it to a rich man in Jidoor

Please go with him to Crescent

--------------------
Gestahl: I see…
[NEWPAGE]
Well, let's let him stew in his
cell for a while… Then we can
decide what to do.
--------------------
[CHOICE] Why did you start the war?
[CHOICE] Why do you want peace now?
[CHOICE] Why'd you have us talk to your
     men?
--------------------
Gestahl: It was all the result of
my foolish lust for power…
I've come to my senses now.
--------------------
Gestahl: Because I now believe
that working together is our
only hope.
--------------------
Gestahl: Some of my men still
do not believe we should have
ended the war.
[NEWPAGE]
I felt they might better
understand if they could meet
you face to face.
--------------------
Gestahl: With your permission,
I'd like to move on to
discussing the espers…
--------------------
[CHOICE] I still have a few questions.
[CHOICE] Okay.
--------------------
[CHOICE] I still have a few questions.
[CHOICE] Let's talk about the espers.
--------------------
Gestahl: I assure you, the
answer I gave you was the
whole and honest truth.
--------------------
Gestahl: The Empire has been
decimated by the espers that
emerged from the Sealed Gate.
[NEWPAGE]
They're just too powerful…
If we don't do something,
they'll tear the entire world
apart!
--------------------
[CHOICE] They have gone a bit too far…
[CHOICE] You're the one who brought
     them here in the first place!
--------------------
Gestahl: When the espers came
through on their rampage, all
of my ambitions faded in an
instant.
[NEWPAGE]
Now I find myself asking why I
ever wanted that much power
in the first place.
[NEWPAGE]
Of course, there is no excuse
for the atrocities I committed
in the name of conquest.
[NEWPAGE]
By the way… what was that
first question you asked me a
minute ago?
--------------------
Gestahl: Right…
Anyway, I truly desire peace.
I want you to understand that.
--------------------
Cid: You must be getting tired…
Why don't we take a short
break?
--------------------
[CHOICE] (Take a break)
[CHOICE] (Keep talking)
--------------------
Resume the conversation?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
Gestahl: Is there anything you
wish to hear me say?
--------------------
[CHOICE] That you really want peace.
[CHOICE] That your war is truly over.
[CHOICE] That you're sorry.
--------------------
Gestahl: …
--------------------
Cid: I hope we're truly able to
bring about peace…
--------------------
Soldier: We'd like to test your
strength.
[NEWPAGE]
Would you agree to fight with
us for a couple minutes?
[CHOICE] Sure
[CHOICE] No, thanks
--------------------
Soldier: Just as we thought…
--------------------
Gestahl: All right. I truly and
sincerely wish for peace. And
now, I have a favor to ask…
--------------------
Gestahl: All right. I swear right
here and now that there will
be no more fighting.
[NEWPAGE]
And now, I have a favor to
ask…
--------------------
Gestahl: All right. I sincerely
apologize for all of the
suffering I have caused.
[NEWPAGE]
And now, I have a favor to
ask…
--------------------
Gestahl: After they attacked us,
the espers flew off northward,
towards Crescent Island.
[NEWPAGE]
We have no way of knowing
when they'll decide to go on
another
rampage.
[NEWPAGE]
We need to find them and
convince them to set aside
their aggression before that
happens.
[NEWPAGE]
But… considering all that the
Empire has done to them, I
doubt they'll be willing to listen
to us.
[NEWPAGE]
That's why… [LONGPAUSE]I need to borrow
[TERRA]'s power.
--------------------
[TERRA] is the only one who
can bridge the gap between
human and esper.
--------------------
Gestahl: I have a Magitek armor
transport ship moored in the
port of Albrook…
[NEWPAGE]
I had hoped to send it to
Crescent Island with all haste.
[NEWPAGE]
Would you please go on board?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
Gestahl: We cannot simply
ignore the espers!
[NEWPAGE]
Please… you must help!
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
Gestahl: I'll have my top
general and some of his troops
accompany you as well.
General Leo!
--------------------
Leo: I'm General Leo. Pleased to
make your acquaintance.

[SABIN]: Didn't I see that
guy in Doma…? Oh, right…!
He was the one with principles…
[NEWPAGE]
So… that's General Leo, eh?
--------------------
Leo: Isn't that…!? [CYAN],
retainer to the king of Doma!
[NEWPAGE]
Please, forgive me for not
being there to stop Kefka…
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: …
What happened was not your
fault.
--------------------
Leo: I'll be waiting for you in
Albrook.
--------------------
Gestahl: Please, find the espers
and convince them to cease
their attacks. You're our only
hope.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: If [TERRA] goes,
I go.
--------------------
[TERRA]: [LOCKE]…
Thank you.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: The rest of you
stay here. I smell a rat…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: As do I…
It's hard to trust the emperor
just like that…
--------------------
[CYAN]: We'll remain here
and watch for anything out of
the ordinary.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Thanks.
You'll be our eyes and ears.
Keep your guard up!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Right.
You be careful, too!
--------------------
Gestahl: I am truly sorry about
what occurred in Doma.
[NEWPAGE]
No one ever dreamed Kefka
would use poison.
--------------------
[CHOICE] What's done is done…
[CHOICE] That was inexcusable.
[CHOICE] Apologize again!
--------------------
Gestahl: I'm terribly sorry
about what was done.
[NEWPAGE]
I promise to punish Kefka
severely and to work to
eradicate poisons all over the
world.
--------------------
Gestahl: By the way… With
regard to General [CELES]…
--------------------
[CHOICE] Was she an Imperial spy?
[CHOICE] [CELES] is one of us!
[CHOICE] We trust her whether she
     spied or not.
--------------------
Gestahl: Kefka was lying.
[NEWPAGE]
General [CELES] realized the
lunacy of this war long before
I did and went over to your
side.
[NEWPAGE]
Was there anything else you
wanted to ask?

Hmm… I guess some people
can't be pushed around…
--------------------
Long live the Empire!
--------------------
Why do I have to join up with
the likes of you!?
--------------------
You're strong… Maybe you
really can do something about
the espers…
--------------------
Espers… Who'd have dreamed
they were that powerful…
--------------------
…
This is ridiculous…
--------------------
I heard you're the strongest of
the Returners… Just how tough
are you?
--------------------
Wow, you're really as strong as
they say!
--------------------
Still alive, huh…?
--------------------
Returner scum!
--------------------
Hmph. Not bad!
--------------------
Everything will be settled at
tonight's banquet.
--------------------
I bear a message from the
emperor.
[NEWPAGE]
Due to your decorum at
tonight's banquet and your
grace in speaking to our
soldiers beforehand…
[NEWPAGE]
…the emperor has decided upon
the following.
--------------------
All Imperial troops will be
withdrawn from South Figaro
immediately.
--------------------
BLANK LINE: 0x5303FF
--------------------
We will also unlock the armory
at the Imperial observation
post to the east.
[NEWPAGE]
You are welcome to any of the
weapons and armor within.
--------------------
And this is a personal gift from
the emperor himself…
[NEWPAGE]
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Ribbon!
--------------------
Cid: This is a nice ship you've
got here!
[NEWPAGE]
[SETZER]: The shock from our
crash really banged up the
engine. It's gonna take a while
to fix…
--------------------
Finally, I was told to give you
this because of your impeccable
behavior at dinner.
[NEWPAGE]
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Ward Bangle!
--------------------
Cid: Let me help you! I know my
way around an engine!
--------------------
Well then, if you'll excuse me…
--------------------
[SETZER]: I think I'll pass.
--------------------
Cid: You know, we could really
speed this baby up if we axed
the casino and streamlined her
a bit…
--------------------
[SETZER]: …That's not open to
discussion. Now, will you please
get out of here?
--------------------
Cid: Oh well… Would've been at
least twice as fast, too…
Maybe three times…
--------------------
[TERRA]: You really love this
ship, don't you?
[NEWPAGE]
[SETZER]: It may be hard to
believe, considering how I live
now, but I used to be a driven
man.
--------------------
[TERRA]: …Really?
--------------------
[SETZER]: I wanted to make
this the fastest ship in the
world, and fly it across the
open sky…
[NEWPAGE]
That was always my dream.
--------------------
[TERRA]: Is that any
different from what you're
doing now?
[NEWPAGE]
[SETZER]: Back then, there
was a person who kept me
working towards my dream…
[NEWPAGE]
The pilot of the Falcon, the
fastest airship ever made.
[NEWPAGE]
At times we were friendly
rivals, and at times we were
simply friends.
[NEWPAGE]
We'd always talk about our
dreams…
[NEWPAGE]
Like which of us would be the
first to sail beyond the sky to
the stars.
[NEWPAGE]
But then she vanished along
with the Falcon, and that was
the end of youthful dreams.
--------------------
[SETZER]: …
Darill…
--------------------
Leo: Ah, there you are.
[NEWPAGE]
Another Imperial general and a
man I hired back in town will
be accompanying us as well.
--------------------
Leo: We should arrive
tomorrow morning.
Why don't you rest until then?
--------------------
[TERRA]: [CELES]…
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: …
--------------------
[LOCKE]: [CELES]…
--------------------
Leo: All right… Let's go.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: I'm working for
the Empire. But don't worry…
they didn't hire me to kill you.
--------------------
General Leo's waiting for you.
--------------------
Sorry, I'm discussing our plans
with General Leo right now.
--------------------
Leo: Let me introduce them…
General [CELES]… and
[SHADOW].
--------------------
Leo: Is something the matter?
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: No, it's nothing…
--------------------
Leo: We depart tomorrow. In
the meantime, I've arranged
lodging for you at the inn.
--------------------
Leo: Please, try to get some
rest.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: I'd better let this
guy stretch his legs before he
gets cooped up on the boat…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: …Urgh…
…world's greatest treasure
hunter… reduced to this…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Please… [LONGPAUSE]
Why won't you talk to me?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: [CELES]…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I know, I doubted
you… if only for a moment.
But… [LONGPAUSE]We can still be friends,
right…?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: [CELES]!
--------------------
Leo: Having trouble sleeping?
--------------------
Leo: I hear your emotions have
returned…
--------------------
[TERRA]: …It's strange, isn't
it?
[NEWPAGE]
The Empire used me, controlled
my very thoughts… and now
here I am, cooperating with the
same people.
--------------------
Leo: People are people. Not
everyone in the Empire is like
Kefka.
--------------------
[TERRA]: So… [LONGPAUSE]what about
you?
--------------------
Leo: I knew that you were half
esper and being made to suffer
through horrible experiments…
[NEWPAGE]
…Yet I did nothing. I'm no
better than Kefka.
--------------------
[TERRA]: If a human and an
esper can love one another…
[NEWPAGE]
Do you think a human and I
could love each other?
--------------------
Leo: Of course!
--------------------
[TERRA]: But… [LONGPAUSE]
I don't even know what it feels
like to love someone.
--------------------
Leo: You're still young. [LONGPAUSE]
…Someday you'll know.
I'm sure of it.
--------------------
[TERRA]: But… [LONGPAUSE]
I want to know now…
--------------------
[TERRA]: Who's there…?
--------------------
[SHADOW]: I thought I'd sleep
out under the stars.
--------------------
[TERRA]: Did you… [LONGPAUSE]hear what
we were talking about?
--------------------
[TERRA]: So…
--------------------
[SHADOW]: I can't help you.
Those are answers you'll have
to find for yourself.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: I didn't mean to
overhear.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: [TERRA].
--------------------
[SHADOW]: There are people
in this world who have chosen
to kill their own emotions.
[NEWPAGE]
Remember that.
--------------------
Leo: We're almost to Crescent
Island. When we make landfall,
we'll split into two groups.
[NEWPAGE]
I'll go with [CELES].
[TERRA], you go with
[LOCKE] and [SHADOW].
[NEWPAGE]
If you find any clues as to
where the espers may be
hiding, report back at once!
--------------------
Leo: [TERRA], let's continue
last night's conversation the
next time we meet…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Let's go.
--------------------
[CELES]: I, um…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Come on.
--------------------
Oh, wow! We don't see many
travelers around here.
--------------------
Mayor: Welcome, welcome! [LONGPAUSE]
Magic…? What's that?
--------------------
Mayor: Please, don't tell anyone
that we can use magic!
--------------------
You can use rods as items in
battle to unleash incredibly
powerful magic.
[NEWPAGE]
Only problem is, they shatter
the first time you use them!
--------------------
Have you talked to old man
[STRAGO]? The innkeeper
should be a little more
reasonable once you have.
--------------------
The innkeeper doesn't like
strangers. Always overcharges
them.
--------------------
Outsiders…
[NEWPAGE]
It's gonna cost you 1500 Gil if
you wanna stay here.
[CHOICE] (Pay)
[CHOICE] (Don't pay)
--------------------
Espers? What in the world are
those?
[NEWPAGE]
If they're some kind of beast,
you should ask the old man who
lives on the edge of town.
--------------------
Heh-heh. You're not gettin' in
here!
--------------------
Old man [STRAGO] may not
look like much now, but he used
to be an amazing hunter.
--------------------
Have you met [RELM]?
She paints. I should see if she'd
paint my picture!
--------------------
[RELM] isn't really
[STRAGO]'s grandchild. I heard
she's a friend's daughter.
That's only a rumor, though.
--------------------
Old man [STRAGO] is a master
of what's known as blue magic.
He can memorize spells that he
sees monsters use.
[NEWPAGE]
Of course, he can't very well
learn the spell if he's asleep or
confused when the monster
casts it!
--------------------
Listen, I should tell you… [LONGPAUSE]
No, never mind.
--------------------
Waaah! My house burned down!
--------------------
Buzz off!
--------------------
I've never seen you before.
--------------------
… [LONGPAUSE]Hmph!
--------------------
And who might you be?
--------------------
1 Gil per night. Why not relax
for a spell?
[NEWPAGE]
How about it?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
What brings you young folks to
see me?
--------------------
An elderly gentleman who has
spent his whole life pursuing
the secrets of monsters…
--------------------
Fire!
--------------------
Hmm? Where did that voice
come from?
--------------------
Huh? Uh-oh!
--------------------
Mama, I got an owie!
--------------------
Oh, all right. Cur--
--------------------
-io… Yes, I think I left the
medicine in the curio cabinet…
--------------------
Mama!
Why won't you use Cure on
me!?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Espers, eh?
Hmm… Haven't heard that word
in years.
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: So, you know about
espers?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Nope! Sure don't!
Don't know a thing. [LONGPAUSE]
Not [LONGPAUSE]one [LONGPAUSE]thing!
--------------------
Grandpa!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Hey!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: What do you think
you're doing, young missy?
--------------------
In her pictures, she captures
everything: forests, water,
light… the very essence
of the things she paints…
--------------------
Something's fishy here…
--------------------
[RELM]: Grandpa, who are
they? Are they friends? Can
they use magic, too?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Sh-shush!
--------------------
[RELM]: What a cute doggy!
[NEWPAGE]
[SHADOW]: Back off. He bites.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Go back to your
room!
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: Why do I have to go
to my room? You never let me
have any fun!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Because I said so!
Now shoo!
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: …Fine.
--------------------
[RELM]: Hmph!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Oh, dear…
Seems to have taken a liking to
your dog…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: That child…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: My apologies.
[NEWPAGE]
[SHADOW]: It's fine. He usually
doesn't like other people,
though…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Anyhow… I'm
terribly sorry, but I really don't
think I can be of any help to
you folks.
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: I, uh… I see…
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: We're just your
ordinary, quiet little village…
[NEWPAGE]
You're not going to find anyone
who knows about any of those
esper things here, I'm afraid!
[NEWPAGE]
Not in Thamasa!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Hmm… [LONGPAUSE]
There's something
strange about this place…
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: Let's have a look
around the village.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Thanks for your
time!
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Sorry I couldn't
be more helpful!
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Interceptor!
--------------------
[RELM]: Bye-bye!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Ah, what a beautiful
day!
--------------------
[RELM]: Interceptor, come
back to play again sometime!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: You've gotta help!
[RELM]… she's…!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Something happened
to [RELM]?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Yes! She was on
fire… and then it caught the
neighbor's house on fire… and…
[NEWPAGE]
Oh, I can't even think straight
anymore, but…!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Please!
You have to help her!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: [SHADOW]!
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Interceptor… [LONGPAUSE]
Where did you go!?
--------------------
Waaah! My house…!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: [RELM]'s in
there!
--------------------
Fire in the village!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: [RELM]!!!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: What're you doing?
--------------------
Flames BEGONE! [PAUSE_01][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
Mayor: Magic is forbidden!
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: Magic!?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: I don't care! [LONGPAUSE]
[RELM]'s inside!
--------------------
Mayor!
--------------------
Mayor: All right… [LONGPAUSE]
We really have no choice.
--------------------
Mayor: Stand back.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: It's no use!
The fire's too strong!
[NEWPAGE]
Mayor: They were storing an
awful lot of flame rods in
there…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: I'm going in!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Wait…
I'll go with you.
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Count me in, too.
I'm not gonna let an old geezer
go in there on his own!
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Who are you calling
a geezer!? I'm only seventy,
and fit as a fiddle!
[NEWPAGE]
"Geezer", he says…
--------------------
Quickly!
--------------------
Is this what started the blaze!?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: The fire's spreading
fast…
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: Looks like this
house could collapse at any
second…
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: We have to hurry
and find [RELM]!
--------------------
Oh no! We're too late! [PAUSE_02][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
Huh!? [PAUSE_01][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[STRAGO]: [RELM]!
Where are you!?
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Time to get out of
here! [LONGPAUSE]I'll use a smoke bomb!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Are you okay?
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: Yeah. Thanks,
Grandpa…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: These folks are the
ones you should be thanking!
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: Thank you.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: I guess our little
secret is out now…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Everyone in this
village can use magic, can't
they? What is this place…?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: This is… [LONGPAUSE]
…the village of the magi.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: A long, long time
ago, humans used magicite to
acquire magical powers…
[NEWPAGE]
Those who gained the ability to
use magic were the people
known as the magi.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I didn't think there
were any magi left in the
world…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: After the War of
the Magi, the espers fled to a
new realm beyond the Sealed
Gate.
[NEWPAGE]
They wished to live in peace,
without fear of their powers
being used by others.
[NEWPAGE]
That left only humans in this
realm, and the ordinary ones
feared the magi's power.
[NEWPAGE]
The horror of the war was still
fresh in their minds…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: It soon turned into
an inquisition. Magi were
hunted down and executed.
[NEWPAGE]
Oh, there were trials, of
course… but they were merely
for show.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: Even though the
only difference was that they
could use magic…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: The few who
managed to escape took up
shelter here. They were our
ancestors.
[NEWPAGE]
Our powers have weakened as
our magi blood has thinned, but
they remain… in some form or
another.
--------------------
[TERRA]: If you're up to it… [LONGPAUSE]
do you think you'd be willing to
help us?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: You said you're
looking for some espers, right?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Well, I do owe you
one for saving [RELM]… [LONGPAUSE]
I'll help you find your espers.
--------------------
[RELM]: I wanna go, too!
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: I think not, young
lady!
--------------------
[RELM]: Fuddy-duddy…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: But… where do we
start?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Hmm… [LONGPAUSE]If they came
this way, they may be hiding in
the mountains to the west.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Why there?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Those mountains
are teeming with magical
energy.
[NEWPAGE]
According to legend, they're a
sacred place to the espers.
--------------------
[TERRA]: Perhaps the magic
of that place drew them there
after they went berserk…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: It's worth a look.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Don't get the wrong
idea. I just wanted my dog
back.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: You're leaving?
[NEWPAGE]
[SHADOW]: I'll search for the
espers my own way.
--------------------
Ultros: Heh-heh-heh…
These shiny golden statues are
all mine! I'll be rich beyond my
slimiest dreams!
--------------------
Ultros: Ohhh! They're all glowy
and sparkly! So purdy…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Hey squidbrain!
Don't you ever learn?
[NEWPAGE]
Ultros: Well, Mama always said
I was a slow learner… [LONGPAUSE]but at
least I never give up!
--------------------
[RELM]: Hey! Did you see
me? Wasn't I great? I'd be way
more useful than Gramps!
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: G-Gramps!?
--------------------
[TERRA]: It wouldn't hurt to
bring her along, would it?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Are these… [LONGPAUSE]
…statues of the Warring Triad!?
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: The Warring Triad?
--------------------
The dawn of magic…
[NEWPAGE]
Three gods descended from the
heavens. Fearing one another's
power, the gods began to war.
[NEWPAGE]
Those mortals caught amongst
their fighting became espers,
and were forced to fight
endlessly as slaves to the gods.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: There are letters
chiseled into the back of these
things…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: So, uh, what's this
"Warring Triad"?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: They're the
legendary gods who created
the power we know as magic.
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: So… they're the
gods of magic?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: You could say that.
--------------------
[TERRA]: This place is
brimming with magic…
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Those three gods
are the creators of magic…
meaning they also created the
espers.
[NEWPAGE]
It's said that the espers once
enshrined images of the gods in
a holy place. This must be it…
--------------------
[TERRA]: The espers must
have been drawn here by the
magic of these statues.
--------------------
Realizing their power begot
naught but strife, the gods at
last agreed to seal away their
strength.
[NEWPAGE]
With the last of their fading
magic, the gods returned the
espers' free will, then turned
themselves to stone.
[NEWPAGE]
The last words they left to the
espers were these:
"Never must we be woken."
--------------------
In reverence towards the gods
were these statues made, and
in prayer that their power
would ne'er again be stirred.
[NEWPAGE]
Let them serve as a warning to
future generations of the three
gods who once descended from
the heavens…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Hmm…
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: If the espers were
drawn here by these statues,
they could be just up ahead…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: So what happened
to the gods after they made
the espers?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Supposedly, they
tired of their fighting and
turned themselves to stone.
[NEWPAGE]
Legend has it they can be found
beyond the Sealed Gate, resting
in their eternal slumber.
--------------------
[TERRA]: I wonder if their
magic is what connects the
gate to the Esper Realm?
--------------------
[RELM]: Is this… an esper!?
--------------------
[TERRA]: I had no idea there
were this many…
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Gramps, take
[RELM] and get out of here!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: …What are they
doing!?
--------------------
Yura: Wait!
--------------------
[RELM]: What is it?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: I sense… incredible
magic power in [TERRA].
No… [LONGPAUSE]it's more than just magic…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I wonder if she's
gonna go ballistic again!
--------------------
Yura: You're… different from
the others. [LONGPAUSE]You possess the
same power we do… I can feel
it.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: Yes.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: You're all young
espers from the realm beyond
the gate, aren't you?
[NEWPAGE]
Yura: Entering this realm is
forbidden, but we wanted to do
something for our friends
who'd been turned to magicite.
[NEWPAGE]
We all gathered at the gate.
And just then, [TERRA]
appeared…
--------------------
[TERRA]: I could feel the
strength of your emotions
from the other side of the
gate.
[NEWPAGE]
Yura: When [TERRA] opened
the gate for us, we were
finally able to escape.
[NEWPAGE]
But the moment we stepped
into your realm, we completely
lost control of our powers.
--------------------
Yura: We destroyed an entire
city, and attacked people who
had done no wrong…
--------------------
[TERRA]: The same thing
happened to me…
[NEWPAGE]
When that power suddenly
stirred inside me, I had no
control over it…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: There must be
something in your realm that
dampens your powers.
[NEWPAGE]
Freed of their reins, your
powers ran wild…
--------------------
Yura: It seems even we espers
can lose our senses and do
unforgivable things.
…I'm truly sorry.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: The Empire wants
to make peace with you.
Why don't you come with us?
[NEWPAGE]
Yura: …They would forgive us?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Let's head back to
Thamasa and meet with
General Leo.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: Right!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: General Leo!
[NEWPAGE]
Leo: [LOCKE]!
It seems you found the espers.
I owe you a debt of gratitude.
--------------------
Leo: I am Leo, a general of the
Empire. Might I have your
name?
[NEWPAGE]
Yura: I am Yura.
--------------------
Yura: What we have done to
your people is inexcusable. We
are in no position to ask for
your forgiveness, but…
--------------------
Leo: Speak no further. We did
not seek you out to chastise
you for past mistakes.
[NEWPAGE]
It is we who ought to be
ashamed. We thought of you
only as a means by which to
wage war.
[NEWPAGE]
How close we came to bringing
about a second War of the
Magi!
[NEWPAGE]
Yura: We must put this all
behind us.
--------------------
Kefka: This little hamlet has too
much "boring" and not enough
"burning"… Torch everything!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I think our work is
finally done. It looks like true
peace is finally upon us.
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Let's go back to
Vector.
--------------------
[CELES]: Please, don't say
anything…
--------------------
[RELM]: Those two are hot
and heavy, huh, Grandpa?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: They're young,
dear…
--------------------
Leo: Kefka! What do you think
you're doing!?
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: Hee-hee-hee…
Emperor's orders!
[NEWPAGE]
I'm to turn all these espers into
magicite. Behold! A magicite
mother lode!
--------------------
Leo: Kefka! No!
--------------------
Kefka: Shut up!
--------------------
Magitek Soldier: General Leo,
prepare to meet your end!
--------------------
Leo: It's no use! I'd better fall
back for the time being!
--------------------
Leo: Kefka! [LONGPAUSE]I can no longer
stand by while you commit
these atrocities!
--------------------
Kefka: Uwee-hee-hee…! How
about a little Magitek mayhem?
--------------------
Kefka: Well, I wouldn't want to
turn you down after you came
all this way!
--------------------
Kefka: Wh-what is this!? I feel
tremendous power! Wave after
wave of pure, magical energy…!
--------------------
Kefka: Oh, you all showed up
for my party! I wasn't
expecting you guys! …Gals?
…Whatever!
[NEWPAGE]
But I'm so happy to see you!
After all, you've brought me
more presents!
[NEWPAGE]
And they're all just what I
wanted: magicite!
--------------------
Kefka: First, let's neutralize
those pesky powers of yours…
--------------------
Kefka: Now, little espers…
let's see those presents!
--------------------
Kefka: What a joke! I didn't
know you espers were such
wimps! This isn't even fun…
[NEWPAGE]
Time to wrap things up!
--------------------
Kefka: Eh? You wanna take me
on? Fine. Here I am!
--------------------
Kefka: Hee-hee-hee! This
should be plenty of magicite…
[NEWPAGE]
Now all I need to do is claim
that final treasure beyond your
precious Sealed Gate!
--------------------
I got this bruise…
It hurts when I push it. [LONGPAUSE]
…Ouch!
--------------------
Curse Kefka!
Curse the Empire!
--------------------
The espers… were they all
killed?
--------------------
Mayor: I can at least take
comfort in the fact that there
weren't many casualties among
the villagers…
--------------------
[TERRA]: General Leo…
--------------------
[TERRA]: People only seem to
want power, don't they? Do
they really want to be like me?
--------------------
[TERRA]: I… I wanted you to
teach me so much more…
--------------------
…Interceptor!? That's a nasty
wound!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Not only Leo, but
[SHADOW], too… [LONGPAUSE]
Curse the Empire!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: That'll have to do
for now, buddy.
--------------------
[CELES]: You're so sweet…
--------------------
[RELM]: Don't worry,
your friend [RELM] will take
care of you!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Now I'm worried
about [EDGAR] and the
others back in the Empire…
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: I hope they're all
right…
--------------------
[SETZER]: We've been had!
The emperor is a liar. It was
all a trap.
--------------------
[CYAN]: Thanks to King
[EDGAR], we managed to
escape before the trap was
sprung.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Good work,
[EDGAR]!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: The lady who
brought us tea tipped me off to
the whole crooked plot…
[NEWPAGE]
I'd barely finished exchanging
pleasantries with her when she
just blurted it out!
--------------------
[SABIN]: …"Pleasantries"?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Did you think I
could be so rude as to meet a
lady and not make any moves
at all?
[NEWPAGE]
It was a matter of courtesy,
dear brother! Courtesy!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: General Leo's dead…
[LONGPAUSE]Kefka… murdered him.
--------------------
[CYAN]: Sir Leo? Dead!? [LONGPAUSE]
What a terrible waste…
[NEWPAGE]
He was one of the few people
in the Empire who truly
understood.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: We need to rethink
our plans. Let's return to the
airship.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Would you mind if I
accompanied you?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: And you would be…?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: He's from this
village.
--------------------
[TERRA]: He's a descendant
of the magi. He'll be useful to
have along.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: The Empire has
abused its power for the last
time.
[NEWPAGE]
We cannot allow them to get
away with this.
--------------------
[RELM]: Weirdo.
I'm going on ahead, okay?
--------------------
[SABIN]: We can't have kids
getting in our way!
--------------------
[RELM]: Who do you think
you are, trying to tell me what
to do, you oversized meatball!?
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Kid's got quite a lip!
--------------------
[RELM]: Grr…!
I'm gonna paint your picture!
--------------------
N-no, [RELM]! Stop!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Oh, all right
already! Not like you stay at
home when you're told,
anyway…
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: Yay!
--------------------
[RELM]: What's wrong,
lover-boy?
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: …How old are you?
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: Ten… Why?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Not even a lady
yet… [LONGPAUSE]Here's hoping you're still
around in eight years, kid.
--------------------
General Leo…
--------------------
Gestahl: Mwa-ha-ha! So this is
the power of the Warring
Triad! With this and my
magicite…
[NEWPAGE]
…the world will be mine to
command!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: The source of all
magic… The Warring Triad…
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: Those things?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: They're said to
have turned themselves to
stone facing one another.
[NEWPAGE]
That way, each one's powers
would be neutralized by those
of the other two.
[NEWPAGE]
If the three were ever moved
out of their perfect alignment…
[NEWPAGE]
…the resulting power imbalance
would destroy the world as we
know it.
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: What!?
--------------------
Let's get back to the airship!
--------------------
[SETZER]: The Imperials were
heading for the Sealed Gate.
[NEWPAGE]
Said they'd found some statues
or something…
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: It couldn't be…!
--------------------
[CELES]: What's wrong,
[TERRA]?
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: The island…
Something's happening!
The earth is crying out…
--------------------
Gestahl: Oh, those half-witted
espers! To think they would
open the gate for us
themselves!
[NEWPAGE]
The Warring Triad is waiting
just beyond that door…
[NEWPAGE]
I need only to reach out and
claim it for my own, and all of
my dreams will be fulfilled!
--------------------
Gestahl: Hurry it up!
--------------------
All right! Let's find a way onto
that thing!
[NEWPAGE]
Form a party of 3!
Everyone else, below deck!
--------------------
Form a party of 3!
Everyone else needs to wait
below deck!
--------------------
Uh-oh! It's the Imperial air
force!
[NEWPAGE]
They've got us surrounded!
We're going to have to engage
them!
--------------------
There's something strange up
ahead! It's coming this way!
--------------------
Just ahead are Kefka, Gestahl…
and the Warring Triad.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: That filthy,
double-crossing Empire…
[NEWPAGE]
Tried to off me the second I
had served my purpose…
[NEWPAGE]
[SHADOW]! We thought you
were dead!
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Is Interceptor all
right?
[NEWPAGE]
He's fine. Come on, let's go!
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Just leave me here.
[NEWPAGE]
Sorry, that's not happening!
--------------------
[SHADOW]: I have no right to
fight at your side… not after I
sold myself to the Empire.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: We meet again.
--------------------
Look! The airship's down there!
[NEWPAGE]
Return to the airship?
[CHOICE] No
[CHOICE] Yes
--------------------
Gestahl: Well, well… look who's
here.
--------------------
[CELES]! What are you doing
here?
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: I followed you.
I have a score to settle with
the Empire!
--------------------
Gestahl: Ha-ha… So you all came
to die together, then… [LONGPAUSE]
Kefka. [LONGPAUSE]Deal with them.
--------------------
Gestahl: Ohhh! What power…!
I've got goose bumps!
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Emperor Gestahl!
Please, stop this madness!
--------------------
Gestahl: [CELES], child…
You alone are special.
[NEWPAGE]
Why don't I give you and Kefka
the task of creating progeny to
populate my new Magitek
empire?
--------------------
Kefka: Kill the others and we'll
forgive your treachery!
--------------------
Kefka: Take this sword!
Kill them all!
--------------------
Gestahl: [CELES]… Together
we will rule the world!
--------------------
[CELES]: Power only breeds
war… It's something we'd all
be better off without.
--------------------
Kefka: Ouch!
--------------------
Kefka: B-blood… Blood! Blood!!!
--------------------
Kefka: You vicious brat!
--------------------
Argh… [LONGPAUSE]Grrr…!
--------------------
You know, you really are a
stupid…
[NEWPAGE]
Vicious…
[NEWPAGE]
Arrogant, whiny, pampered,
backstabbing, worthless…
[NEWPAGE]
LITTLE BRAT!!!
--------------------
Kefka: Gods, you were born to
fight! Now is the time!
I implore you…
Show me your power!
--------------------
Kefka: Let me in here! Grrr…!
--------------------
Kefka: Now listen to me!
No more playing games!
I command you…
Show me your power!
--------------------
Gestahl: Kefka, stop! If you
revive them, they'll destroy the
very world we want to rule!
[NEWPAGE]
There's no value in that!
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: Shut up!
--------------------
Gestahl: The world is about to
learn… the meaning of… fear…
--------------------
[CELES]: No! Kefka!
--------------------
[CELES]: Kefka… No!
If you disturb the balance…
their power will run wild…!
--------------------
Kefka: Who's that!?
--------------------
Kefka: Oof!
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Go!
--------------------
[SHADOW]…
[NEWPAGE]
Come on! We have to get out of
here!
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Forget about me!
Run! There's no stopping this
now!
[NEWPAGE]
I'll find my way back! Trust me!
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: You can't escape me!
--------------------
The airship's below.
[CHOICE] (Jump!)
[CHOICE] (Wait)
--------------------
[CHOICE] (Jump!)
[CHOICE] (Gotta wait for [SHADOW]…)
--------------------
[SHADOW]!
[NEWPAGE]
[SHADOW]: I'd never be able to
rest in peace if I died without
collecting my pay…
--------------------
There's no way to stop their
magic?
--------------------
[SETZER]: Hang on!
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]On that day,
[CENTER]the world changed forever…
[PAUSE_FF][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
Cid: Oh, [CELES]…!
--------------------
Cid: You're finally awake!
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: How… how long
have I been sleeping?
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: One year, as of today.
I was starting to think you
might be out for good.
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: A whole year… [LONGPAUSE]
You've been taking care of me
all this time?
--------------------
Cid: Yes… And I must say, I'm
a bit knackered…
--------------------
Cid: We're on a tiny, deserted
island. After the world was
torn apart, I awoke to find us
here.
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: After the world
was torn apart…? So, that
wasn't just a dream…
--------------------
[CELES]: What about
everyone else?
…Where's [LOCKE]?
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: I don't know.
[NEWPAGE]
For all I know, this island could
be the only part of the world
that's still above water.
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: Ever since that day, the
world's been sliding deeper
and deeper into ruin.
[NEWPAGE]
Plants wither, and animals
waste away. The other people
who were here with us all gave
up hope…
[NEWPAGE]
One after the next, they flung
themselves from the northern
cliffs in despair…
--------------------
[CELES]: So… everyone
could already be…
--------------------
Cid: [CELES]… Try not to
take it so hard. We can still
live out our lives together in
peace!
[NEWPAGE]
You're the closest thing to
family I have left in this
world…
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Yes…
I suppose you're right, Cid…
[NEWPAGE]
Or should I say… Granddad?
Is it all right if I call you that?
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: Granddad, eh? Heh-heh…
You're going to make an old
man blush!
[NEWPAGE]
All of a sudden I have a
granddaughter! [LONGPAUSE]*hack* [LONGPAUSE]
*cough*
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Hee-hee!
Granddad…
--------------------
Cid: Ha-ha-ha…
*hack*! *cough*!
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: You must be
hungry, Granddad…
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: I… actually haven't had
anything to eat since I fell ill
three days ago.
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: What would you
like?
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: Well, unless I ask for fish,
I won't get anything! That's all
there is here.
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: I'll go catch some.
--------------------
Cid: I'm all better now!
Thank you, [CELES]!
--------------------
Cid: I can feel my strength
returning.
--------------------
Cid: [CELES]… Thank you
for taking caring of me like
this, day after day…
--------------------
Cid: *cough* I'm starting to
feel a lot better.
--------------------
Cid: *cough* *hack* I just
can't seem to shake this thing…
--------------------
Cid: I'm afraid… I may not be
long for this world…
--------------------
Cid: No matter what happens to
me… you mustn't lose hope!
*cough* *wheeze*
--------------------
Cid: *cough* *hack*
[CELES]… while I can still
talk, I… *cough* want to…
*wheeze*
[NEWPAGE]
…thank you… *gasp*!
--------------------
Cid: This is the end for me…
--------------------
…
--------------------
[CELES]: Granddad, here's a
fish! Eat up!
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: Thank you…
*munch* *chomp* *chew*
--------------------
[CELES]: What is it?
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: [CELES]… I finally
finished the little project I've
been working on at night.
[NEWPAGE]
Go on downstairs and take a
look!
--------------------
[CELES]: Granddad…
You have to eat, or…
[NEWPAGE]
Wh-what's the matter?
Granddad…
--------------------
[CELES]: Cid…
--------------------
[CELES]: No! …No!!!
You promised you'd stay here
with me!
--------------------
[CELES]: Granddad!
Answer me! Tell me you're just
joking!
--------------------
[CELES]: Granddad…!
--------------------
[CELES]: Granddad…
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: [CELES]…
You have to leave this place.
[NEWPAGE]
I'm sure your friends are still
alive somewhere, waiting for
you!
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: …I know they are.
I'll go. But I'll be back!
And I'll bring them all back to
see you!
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: You bring that [LOCKE]
fellow, too, now, you hear?
--------------------
[CELES]: I'll make you proud
of me, Granddad…
--------------------
Cid: The other people who were
here with us all gave up hope…
[NEWPAGE]
One after the next, they flung
themselves from the northern
cliffs in despair…
--------------------
[CELES]: Everyone's gone…
Even [LOCKE]…
[NEWPAGE]
There's nothing left for me in
this world.
--------------------
[CELES]: Uhhhn… Were you
watching over me? Why would
you want to help someone like
me?
[NEWPAGE]
I've already given up hope…
--------------------
[CELES]: This bandana… [LONGPAUSE]
It couldn't be…!
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Hey, little bird…
Where'd you come from?
[NEWPAGE]
Is the person who wrapped
your wound still alive?
Please, tell me…!
--------------------
[CELES]: He's alive… [LONGPAUSE]
[LOCKE]'s alive!
--------------------
"You must leave this island.
[SPACE_07]Somewhere out there, your
[SPACE_07]friends are waiting for you."
[NEWPAGE]
"Go down the stairs by the
[SPACE_07]stove. The road to your
[SPACE_07]freedom awaits…
[SPACE_20]- Love, Grandad"
--------------------
Thank you so much for saving
my child. I'll never be able to
repay you!
--------------------
I got this strange feeling Kefka
was watching, then the whole
town started shaking…
Scared me out of my mind!
--------------------
Anyone who opposes Kefka is
killed. He burns down their
entire town from his tower
with the Light of Judgment.
--------------------
I was there… I saw when Kefka
used his Light of Judgment to
torch the village of Mobliz, far
to the east.
[NEWPAGE]
The adults all perished trying to
shield their children…
--------------------
The Serpent Trench is no longer
a valley in the ocean floor.
It's above the surface now.
Eerie place, too…
[NEWPAGE]
Apparently, some members of
the Cult of Kefka have built
themselves a tower there.
--------------------
I heard that a terrifying
monster named Humbaba has
taken up residence in the area
around Mobliz.
--------------------
To the east, you'll find the
valley that was once the
Serpent Trench. If you keep
going east, you'll find Mobliz.
[NEWPAGE]
I heard the village was burned
to the ground by the Light of
Judgment, though…
--------------------
Head north along the Serpent
Trench and you'll find the town
of Nikeah. Ships are still sailing
out of there.
--------------------
*sniffle* That was scary…
--------------------
My little boy's still inside!
Please, help him!
I'm begging you!
--------------------
All this, just because someone
acted against Kefka's will…
--------------------
There are monsters inside that
house! They keep petrifying
everyone who goes in to help.
[NEWPAGE]
You'd better have some relics
that'll keep you safe!
--------------------
We refused to bow down to
Kefka, so he unleashed the
Light of Judgment on us!
--------------------
Hurry, or the house'll
collapse!
--------------------
[CELES]: [SABIN]!
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Oh…! [CELES]!
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Let me help you!
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Wait!
--------------------
[SABIN]!
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Hey… You're alive!
[NEWPAGE]
Let me help you!
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Wait!
--------------------
[SABIN]: If I move,
the whole house'll collapse.
First… [LONGPAUSE]save the kid who's
inside!
[NEWPAGE]
I don't think I can hold this up
much longer… You've gotta
hurry! …Urgh!
--------------------
[SABIN]: I can't… hold out…
…any longer…
Brother… the rest is up to you!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Took you long
enough!
--------------------
[CELES]: [SABIN]!
You're alive!
--------------------
[SABIN]!
You're alive!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Of course I am!
[NEWPAGE]
Did you think a little thing like
the end of the world was gonna
do me in?
--------------------
[CELES]: I'd given up hope…
I thought everyone else had
died… But… [LONGPAUSE]
I was wrong!
[NEWPAGE]
I'm sure we're not the only
ones! We need to find
everyone! And then…
--------------------
We'd almost given up hope…
We didn't think anyone else was
left.
[NEWPAGE]
But… [LONGPAUSE]we were
wrong! We're not the only ones!
We need to gather everyone!
And then…
--------------------
[SABIN]: …smash Kefka,
and make the world peaceful
again! All right, count me in!
--------------------
Please help him! I'm begging
you!
--------------------
I'll heal you, but please…!
Save the child trapped inside
that house!
--------------------
"I'm scared…!"
[NEWPAGE]
Don't worry, you're safe now!
--------------------
Did you see that tower…?
--------------------
Kefka's practically a god now,
sitting up in that tower of his
with the power of the Warring
Triad at his command…
--------------------
The world's ruined…
There's nothing left…
--------------------
Oppose Kefka's will, and he'll
fry your town with the Light of
Judgment. There's no point in
even trying…
--------------------
On the day the world was
shattered, debris gravitated to
the center of this continent
from all over the world.
[NEWPAGE]
That's what formed Kefka's
tower.
--------------------
With things the way they are
now, business is the last thing
on my mind.
--------------------
Many ancient monsters that
had long been sealed away
were released when the world
was ripped apart…
[NEWPAGE]
Humbaba, Deathgaze… even the
eight legendary dragons.
--------------------
I saw Deathgaze soaring up
among the clouds the other
day!
[NEWPAGE]
I'd hate to think what would
happen if some poor sod in an
airship ran across that thing…
--------------------
Hmm? You wouldn't be…? [LONGPAUSE]
No, never mind.
[NEWPAGE]
It's just… a man came through
here looking for someone
recently, and you match the
description perfectly.
[NEWPAGE]
The man already left, though.
He said he was going to head
north, to Tzen.
--------------------
That sparkle in your eye
reminds me of the young
martial artist who visited here
not long ago.
[NEWPAGE]
He had that same determined
look…
--------------------
Oh, those wondrous days of
plenty…
--------------------
I wonder if we'll ever see days
like those again?
--------------------
[RELM]: Come on now, you
stubborn old bag of bones!
Snap out of it!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: [RELM]!
[RELM], is it really you?
You're alive!?
--------------------
[RELM]: Grandpa, you idiot!
What were you thinking?
[NEWPAGE]
[STRAGO]: Oh, [RELM]…
I was sure you were…
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: Did you really think
I was gonna check out before
you, you old geezebag!? [LONGPAUSE]
Ha-ha-ha…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Oh, you're as
foul-mouthed as ever, bless
your heart!
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: Come on, Grandpa.
You're coming along with
the rest of us!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Whoa! Well, I'll be…!
[NEWPAGE]
All right… Guess I can't be
leaving everything up to you
whippersnappers!
--------------------
This tower's home to the Cult
of Kefka. There's supposed to
be a priceless treasure up on
the highest level…
[NEWPAGE]
But you can only use magic
inside, so you'll never make it
to the top without strong
magic!
--------------------
Treasure… Treasure…
--------------------
For 100,000 Gil, I'll tell ya
where some hidden treasure is!
[CHOICE] (Pay 100,000 Gil)
[CHOICE] (Decline)
--------------------
Thanks! You're too generous! [LONGPAUSE]
Right, the scoop…
[NEWPAGE]
There's an ancient castle buried
beneath the desert of Figaro…
and no doubt loaded with
treasure!
[NEWPAGE]
By the way, I heard the old
man who lives in the weapon
shop in Narshe was looking for
ya…
--------------------
No use talking to them.
They've given their souls over
to Kefka.
[NEWPAGE]
All they do now is shuffle
about, praying to him day in
and day out…
--------------------
Lord Kefka's treasure…
Return… the treasure…
--------------------
Aaahhh! Someone's coming!
--------------------
You're gonna have to fight your
way in here! We can fight, too,
you know!
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Wait!
--------------------
[TERRA]!
--------------------
Mama! Are these people your
friends?
--------------------
[TERRA]: I'm so glad to see
you're safe! I missed you so
much!
--------------------
[TERRA], come with us!
There's no saving this world
unless we defeat Kefka once
and for all…
[NEWPAGE]
[TERRA]: I know… But…
--------------------
[TERRA]: I… [LONGPAUSE]
I can't fight anymore.
--------------------
[TERRA]: The very day the
world collapsed, Kefka turned
his Light of Judgment on this
village.
[NEWPAGE]
The adults… these kids'
parents… They all died trying to
protect their children…
--------------------
[TERRA]: This is a village of
children now… [LONGPAUSE]They clung to me
from the moment I arrived…
[NEWPAGE]
They needed me…
--------------------
Duane: You can't take
[TERRA] from us!
--------------------
Katarin: Duane…
[NEWPAGE]
Please, forgive him. It's just…
if we lose [TERRA], we lose
the only thing that's holding
this village together.
--------------------
[TERRA]: I don't know why
these kids need me…
[NEWPAGE]
And it's not like there's
anything forcing me to protect
them. It's the strangest
feeling…
[NEWPAGE]
But once that feeling took root
inside of me, I lost the strength
to keep on fighting.
--------------------
[TERRA]: I feel like I'm on
the verge of understanding
something important.
[NEWPAGE]
It's hard to describe… But the
harder I look for the answer,
the more I lose my strength to
fight.
--------------------
Help!!! Humbaba's coming!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Humbaba… The
ancient monster released from
the depths of the earth by the
cataclysm…
[NEWPAGE]
…I have to protect the village!
--------------------
[TERRA]! Wake up!
Uh-oh… Here it comes!
--------------------
[TERRA]: I guess I really
don't have the strength to fight
anymore…
--------------------
Mama! Are you okay!?
--------------------
[TERRA]: I'm staying here.
I wouldn't be any help to you
now. And… the children need
me.
[NEWPAGE]
But, [TERRA]…
--------------------
[TERRA]: Maybe after a little
more time has passed…
[NEWPAGE]
I need to understand what's
happening to me.
--------------------
Thanks for scaring Humbaba
away! This fell off the chain
around his neck. Here, you can
have it!
[NEWPAGE]
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Fenrir magicite!
--------------------
Mama, are you all right?
--------------------
You can't take Mama away!
--------------------
I can't lose Mama, too…
Not after everyone else…
--------------------
[TERRA]: I'm sorry…
I'm staying here. The children
need me…
--------------------
Katarin's gone…
--------------------
Katarin ran away 'cause
Duane's not nice to her!
--------------------
Katarin's belly keeps getting
bigger!
--------------------
Katarin's gonna have a baby.
I know, 'cause my mom looked
like that before she had my
little brother!
--------------------
Duane: I… don't know what to
do. Katarin's pregnant…
--------------------
[TERRA]: You're back!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Katarin's going to
be having a baby.
--------------------
Katarin: I'm so happy that I'm
going to have a child…
[NEWPAGE]
But when I told that to Duane,
he turned cold all of a sudden…
--------------------
Duane: Katarin… [LONGPAUSE]… [LONGPAUSE]
I'm sorry. I just didn't know
how to handle all of this…
[NEWPAGE]
I acted like an idiot. But
everything's okay now!
So, please… come back home
with me.
--------------------
Aaahhh! Humbaba's headed this
way!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Please!
Protect the village! I… don't
have the strength to fight…
--------------------
Duane: I'll keep Katarin safe.
--------------------
Katarin: I'll be fine with Duane
by my side.
--------------------
Please, beat Humbaba!
You have to!
--------------------
"It's another monster!"
"It's scary…"
"I'm afraid…"
--------------------
Mama… [LONGPAUSE]
It's you, isn't it? [LONGPAUSE]
I can tell…
--------------------
"Huh? Mama?"
"[TERRA]?"
--------------------
"Mama!"
"[TERRA]!"
--------------------
[TERRA]: I… [LONGPAUSE]I'll fight!
--------------------
[TERRA]: I think… I finally
understand. The feeling that's
been growing inside me…
[NEWPAGE]
It must be… [LONGPAUSE]
… [LONGPAUSE]"Love"!
[NEWPAGE]
I have to fight… to protect the
people I love, and to make the
world a safe place for new
lives!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Duane…
Keep Katarin and your baby
safe!
[NEWPAGE]
Children, Mama has to go away
for a while to make the world
a safer place for you to live!
[NEWPAGE]
But I promise I'll be back as
soon as I can!
--------------------
"Mama… I'm not gonna cry!"
"Me either!"
[NEWPAGE]
"I'll be good! Come back soon!"
"Don't forget, you promised!"
--------------------
[TERRA]: Thank you…
You all helped me understand
what it means… to love.
[NEWPAGE]
I'll fight! I'll make this world a
place where life can flourish,
and children can grow up in
peace!
--------------------
Mom and Dad covered us when
the light hit and then they
didn't move any more after
that…
--------------------
We're okay 'cause we've got
[TERRA] here!
--------------------
The soldier in our village who
was hurt went to sleep and
didn't wake up.
--------------------
We all call [TERRA] "Mama".
--------------------
Duane and Katarin are the
oldest ones here. [TERRA]'s
our mama and they're our big
brother and sister!
--------------------
I saw Duane kissing Katarin!
--------------------
You're not gonna take Mama
away, are you?
--------------------
The light took everyone… [LONGPAUSE]
Everyone… [LONGPAUSE]
Mom… [LONGPAUSE]Dad…
--------------------
Duane: This is our village.
You can't just waltz in here
and do whatever you want!
--------------------
Katarin: [TERRA] is the glue
that holds this village together.
With her here, we're somehow
able to keep going.
--------------------
I hope Katarin has her baby
soon! I wanna see it!
--------------------
We'll be all right!
--------------------
Mama… we'll be okay.
We're tough!
--------------------
Duane and Katarin'll take good
care of us.
--------------------
I'm not gonna cry. I don't
wanna make Mama sad…
--------------------
The baby in Katarin's belly is
kicking!
--------------------
There! It just kicked again!
--------------------
Katarin, what're you gonna
name the baby?
--------------------
Duane: A new life… I've got to
do my best to help make the
world a safer place for it.
--------------------
Katarin: We'll be okay.
So please… go make sure these
kids have a future to look
forward to!
--------------------
"It's aimed right at us!"
"Protect the kids!"
--------------------
"Mom!!!"
"Dad!!!"
--------------------
We try to keep a low profile
here so we won't draw Kefka's
ire.
--------------------
The South Figaro ferry has
somehow managed to stay in
business.
--------------------
This ship's been chartered by
the Crimson Robbers.
--------------------
There's a bunch of thieves
hanging out in the pub.
They say they all escaped from
Figaro Castle.
--------------------
The road you took to get here
used to be at the bottom of the
ocean!
--------------------
After the cataclysm, I awoke to
find myself all alone in Doma
Castle.
[NEWPAGE]
When I tried to sleep there,
monsters came for me in my
dreams… Oh, it still frightens
me just to think of it!
--------------------
I heard Figaro Castle ran into
some kind of trouble and got
stuck beneath the desert.
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Leviathan magicite!
--------------------
That tower in the middle of the
Serpent Trench belongs to the
Cult of Kefka.
--------------------
What do you think you're
doing? Get outta here!
Scram!
--------------------
Gerad: You know the way into
Figaro Castle quite well then,
correct?
[NEWPAGE]
Henchman: Ho-ho-ho, do we
ever!
--------------------
Gerad: Then lead the way.
I'll take charge once we're in.
--------------------
They say they all escaped from
Figaro Castle's dungeons.
--------------------
By some freak chance, the
dungeon ended up right next to
a sandworm nest when the
castle stopped.
[NEWPAGE]
A crack opened up in the wall,
so we crawled through and
followed the worm tunnels
back to the surface!
--------------------
We lost our old boss that day…
He's feeding the sandworms
now. We met Gerad here in
town. He's our new boss!
--------------------
The boss wants to sneak into
Figaro Castle to take back our
booty. They've got it all in a
storeroom there.
--------------------
We're gonna go into the castle
through a secret cave that
nobody else knows about!
--------------------
The head of that gang of
thieves, Gerad, was flirting
with me! He's kinda handsome…
Tee-hee-hee!
--------------------
All right, let's go!
--------------------
Gerad: What's your problem?
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Aren't you…
[EDGAR]?
--------------------
[CELES]: [EDGAR]?
[NEWPAGE]
Gerad: I have no idea what
you're talking about… [LONGPAUSE]
I'll take this, too, kid!
--------------------
Gerad: Look, I'm kind of busy
here. I have to get ready.
We're leaving for Figaro on the
ferry soon.
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Don't play dumb
with me, [EDGAR]! [LONGPAUSE]
Wait… you didn't lose your
memory, did you?
--------------------
Gerad: Listen… It grieves me to
have to disappoint such a
beautiful lady, but I've been
Gerad since the day I was born!
--------------------
[SABIN]: Is this some kind
of joke, [EDGAR]?
--------------------
[CELES]: I've never met
anyone else who'd flirt with a
"lady" he was trying to shake
off his tail…
--------------------
Gerad: Being polite to ladies is
common courtesy the whole
world over!
--------------------
Figaro Castle disappeared the
day the world was torn
asunder…
--------------------
Figaro Castle is stuck below the
desert. With no air to breathe,
the people are probably all…
--------------------
That little girl stopped coming
here. Haven't seen her since
that fateful day…
--------------------
I'm so glad the Imperials are
finally gone.
--------------------
This time it's thieves! Phew…
A girl just doesn't get any rest!
--------------------
Now there's nothing left of my
hometown, even if I wanted to
go back…
--------------------
Hop on the turtle!
Oh, hop on the turtle!
[NEWPAGE]
…Oh, uh, that's just a song.
--------------------
Just when we thought we'd be
able to rest easier with the
Empire gone… now we have
Kefka to worry about!
--------------------
In these dark times, I take
solace in the fact that my
grandson survived. So many
others didn't…
--------------------
Duncan's Wife: No, dear!
My hubby's still alive and well!
He's off training now, to the
north of Narshe.
--------------------
Gerad's a boss we can trust!
Does look awfully familiar,
though…
--------------------
Is this some kind of parting
gift from the Empire?
--------------------
Gerad: You're still here!?
--------------------
We're breaking into Figaro
Castle! That treasure belongs to
us!
--------------------
We won't stop till we get our
treasure back!
--------------------
We can't mope around hanging
our heads forever. We have to
start rebuilding!
--------------------
Those men may be thieves, but
at least they're working
towards a goal. We could learn
a thing or two from that.
--------------------
Lives may be lost, but new lives
can be born as well!
[NEWPAGE]
I'm just doing my part!
--------------------
Oh…! I can't believe him!
--------------------
Whoa! I'm getting dizzy!
--------------------
If the Light of Judgment burns
down our town a hundred
times, we'll rebuild it two
hundred times!
[NEWPAGE]
…Wait, does that even make
sense?
--------------------
Did you hear? Duncan's alive!
I heard it from his wife!
--------------------
A young guy just came through
town searching for a legendary
treasure with the power to
bring back the dead.
--------------------
The boss of that gang of
thieves is in the inn on the
second floor.
--------------------
That gang of thieves left town.
--------------------
Gerad: …Just wait.
I'm on my way to help… [LONGPAUSE]
… [LONGPAUSE]You followed me here?
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: You ARE [EDGAR],
aren't you?
--------------------
Boss, everything's ready.
Let's go!
[NEWPAGE]
Gerad: Case of mistaken
identity, my dear. Give it up!
--------------------
Gerad: All right, what now?
--------------------
Henchman: Here, boy…!
Here's some yummy food for a
good little turtle!
--------------------
How 'bout that, eh?
[NEWPAGE]
Gerad: Nice.
[NEWPAGE]
Henchman: Used to have me a
pet turtle…
--------------------
It's dangerous beyond here.
I'll go ahead and clear out all
the nasty, vile monsters.
You just wait here, okay?
--------------------
Come on, let's hurry it up![WAIT_0A][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
Gerad: Are you still with us?
Just hold on a bit longer, okay?
--------------------
C-can't… b-breathe…
--------------------
Gerad: So, this is the problem…
Got its tentacles all tangled up
in the engine…
[NEWPAGE]
Henchman: Boss! What should
we do? Our treasure's in the
storeroom back there!
--------------------
Gerad: I'll keep this thing busy!
You guys go get the treasure!
[NEWPAGE]
Henchman: But… boss!
That's awfully dangerous!
[NEWPAGE]
Gerad: Just get moving!
--------------------
[CELES]: [EDGAR]!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: What are you
standing around for,
[CELES]!? [LONGPAUSE]Give me a hand!
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: [EDGAR]!
It IS you!
--------------------
[CELES]: Acting like you
didn't know me…
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: I'd heard Figaro
had run into some kind of
trouble.
[NEWPAGE]
I wanted to help, but how was
I supposed to get here with the
castle stuck beneath the sand?
[NEWPAGE]
Then I caught wind of the
rumor that those guys had
escaped from the dungeon…
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: So you used them…
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: Bingo. And
obviously, I couldn't let them
find out I was the king of
Figaro…
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: …Because they'd
just escaped from your own
jail.
--------------------
[SABIN]: You could've told
us.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Uh-oh…
We'd better hide!
--------------------
Boss!
…? Boss?
--------------------
That monster must've gotten
him…
--------------------
Poor guy… Didn't even last as
long as our previous boss…
[NEWPAGE]
Oh well… Let's go.
--------------------
You don't care if they take that
treasure…?
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: I couldn't care less
about treasure. What we need
to worry about is Kefka.
[NEWPAGE]
Those guys haven't done
anything wrong… not really.
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: So… you'll come
along?
--------------------
[SABIN]: Let's go shake
things up again!
--------------------
Oh… the engine's working again!
Next stop, the surface!
--------------------
Who'd have thought air could
ever be so precious?
--------------------
Several residents of our castle
left to join the Cult of Kefka.
[NEWPAGE]
Maybe they'd return if a loved
one went and pleaded with
them…
--------------------
Magicite can impart magical
powers to humans… Amazing!
--------------------
I still can't believe that the
power of magic has returned…
--------------------
I hear that some fanatical
members of the Cult of Kefka
insist on spelling Kefka's name
with Cs instead of Ks.
[NEWPAGE]
That just seems silly to me.
Kefka's Kefka. He's still the
same villain, no matter how you
spell his name!
--------------------
I think we all know who really
deserves to be locked up in
here…
--------------------
It seems they discovered an
ancient text in the library.
--------------------
Both the Empire and the
Returners are gone now. It's
time to give serious thought to
what's really important.
--------------------
What is this place…?
--------------------
It's an esper attack!
Let loose our espers!
--------------------
This is the site of a
thousand-year-old battle…
--------------------
Chancellor: Lord Odin is the only
esper left to us!
[NEWPAGE]
Soldier: Has he recovered from
his injuries?
--------------------
Chancellor: Does it matter?
We have no other choice…
We must leave this final battle
in Odin's hands…
--------------------
A city destroyed during the War
of the Magi…
--------------------
Odin: Impressive… I never
thought you would be able to
turn me to stone…
--------------------
There's a legend that tells of
an ancient battle between the
esper, Odin, and a powerful
magus…
[NEWPAGE]
It took place in the great hall
of a castle…
--------------------
There is a book encrusted with
glittering gems…
[NEWPAGE]
"The Princess's Diary"
[NEWPAGE]
"…I've fallen in love with Odin.
[SPACE_07]It is a forbidden love, I know…
[SPACE_07]But the flames of passion obey
[SPACE_07]neither rule nor reason…"
[NEWPAGE]
"Each time I think of that noble
[SPACE_07]man, my heart flutters, and
[SPACE_07]fans the flames yet more! And
[SPACE_07]who could rightly fault it?"
[NEWPAGE]
"When the fighting ends, I shall
[SPACE_07]tell him… I must…"
--------------------
[TERRA]: Love between a
human and an esper…
--------------------
Even the princess was turned
to stone…
--------------------
From the stone, is that…
a tear?
--------------------
The princess' tear transforms
into a sword…

Will you be staying?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
Care to fight in the coliseum?
[CHOICE] With pleasure!
[CHOICE] Nope!
[CHOICE] Could you explain?
--------------------
The toughest fighters from all
over the world come here to
compete.
--------------------
I'm gonna make a killing here!
--------------------
There's a guy who fights here
dressed all in black. They say
he's looking for a blade called
the Narigitsune…
--------------------
We can't let the world become
too peaceful. Don't you see?
People shine their brightest
when they're at war.
[NEWPAGE]
My coliseum will be a
monument to the glory of
battle! …If I can ever finish it,
that is. No one'll help me.
--------------------
Finally the whole world is at
war, and I've fulfilled my
lifelong ambition of building a
coliseum!
[NEWPAGE]
I'm so happy, and I owe it all
to Kefka!
--------------------
Oh, Ultros at the front desk?
He couldn't pay off his debt, so
I put him to work as a
receptionist.
[NEWPAGE]
I figure it'll take him about a
hundred years to work it all
off…
--------------------
Ultros: Me, the great and noble
Ultros, reduced to working as a
receptionist in this stinkin'
coliseum! *sob*
[NEWPAGE]
Oh yeah… [LONGPAUSE]You'd better not bet
any cheap crap, or Mr. Typhon'll
hafta come 'n teach ya a
lesson!
--------------------
Coliseum entrants must wager
items when they fight.
First, choose an item from your
inventory to wager.
[NEWPAGE]
Once you have chosen an item,
your opponent will appear.
Choose a party member to fight
that opponent.
[NEWPAGE]
A one-on-one battle will then
take place. You'll have to use
all of your strength and wits to
defeat your opponent!
[NEWPAGE]
The item you wagered serves
as your entry fee. But if you
win, you'll be rewarded with an
even better item!
[NEWPAGE]
That's all there is to it!
--------------------
The more valuable the item you
wager, the better the prize will
be if you win!
--------------------
All battles in the coliseum are
one-on-one battles. They're
not automatic, though!
--------------------
Gilgamesh: It seems that an
imposter has been
masquerading as me recently…
Don't be tricked!
--------------------
This is the Dragon's Neck
Coliseum. Champions from all
over the world come here to
fight for prizes and glory.
--------------------
What are you doing here?
[NEWPAGE]
[SHADOW]: The only thing I
know how to do… I'm fighting.
--------------------
Why don't you come with us?
[NEWPAGE]
[SHADOW]: Perhaps I should…
--------------------
[SHADOW]: All right! [LONGPAUSE]
It's time to put my skills to the
ultimate test!
--------------------
Hmm? [LOCKE]?
He's probably searching the
world over for that fabled
treasure…
[NEWPAGE]
So, in other words… you find
where that treasure's hidden,
and that's where you'll find
[LOCKE]!
--------------------
Those beautiful days will never
return…
--------------------
Narshe is crawling with
monsters. I have nowhere to go
now. I lost my home…
--------------------
I overheard you talking.
And you know what? [LONGPAUSE]
You're right. It's too early to
give up on the world!
[NEWPAGE]
Why don't you pay Narshe a
visit sometime? You guys just
might be able to wake up that
frozen esper!
--------------------
[LOCKE] left town a while
back. He seemed quite happy,
though.
[NEWPAGE]
Said he'd pinned down the
location of some legendary
treasure…
--------------------
[CELES]: [LOCKE]…
So he really is alive!
--------------------
We planted some flower seeds,
but they won't sprout…
--------------------
The plants have all stopped
growing and flowering. It's as
if they've lost their will to
live…
--------------------
There's a real tough fellow
fightin' in the coliseum. Seems
he's tryin' to get a weapon
called the "Gnarly Geese Tuna".
[NEWPAGE]
…What, am I sayin' it wrong?
--------------------
If life doesn't start returning
to the world soon, it won't
matter how hard we work to
rebuild our village.
--------------------
A charming man with a
mustache came through town
recently. He kept saying "thou"
to everyone!
[NEWPAGE]
I think he said he was headed
for Maranda…
--------------------
[CELES]: [SETZER]!
[NEWPAGE]
[SETZER]: So, you survived…
--------------------
[CELES]: Come with us!
We're going after Kefka.
[NEWPAGE]
[SETZER]: Hmph…
I just don't have the drive to
do that kind of stuff anymore.
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: What are you
talking about!?
[NEWPAGE]
[SETZER]: I'm a gambler…
My world has always been one
where a man's spirit could soar
free…
[NEWPAGE]
Not anymore. I feel like the
weight of this world is crushing
me. It's just too much to bear…
[NEWPAGE]
And on top of that, I've even
lost my wings…
--------------------
[CELES]: You fought with all
your heart before the world
was ruined!
[NEWPAGE]
That couldn't have been easy
either, but you seemed to bear
that just fine!
[NEWPAGE]
[SETZER]: That was then…
All my dreams are gone now.
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: If you need a
dream to chase after, then
why don't you find yourself a
new one?
[NEWPAGE]
Like taking back our world.
--------------------
[SETZER]: Heh-heh…
You know… maybe you're right.
[NEWPAGE]
…You'd chase after it with me,
then? My new dream?
--------------------
[SETZER]: Thanks…
…I think it's time to pay a visit
to Darill's tomb.
--------------------
[SETZER]: …
She's waiting for us… [LONGPAUSE]
…with a new pair of wings!
--------------------
There're still some people with
vision, even in a world like this.
Like my brother up north!
[NEWPAGE]
He built just the thing for a
world like this…
--------------------
Don't step there! You have to
give the seeds a chance to
sprout!
--------------------
Thish world'sh on itsh lasht

--------------------
I overheard your conversation…
I think I'm gonna take one last
shot at making my own dreams
come true!
--------------------
So much for all my hopes and
dreams…
--------------------
Perhaps I was too quick to
abandon hope… People need to
have dreams to hold on to!
--------------------
[CELES]: This is your friend's
grave?
[NEWPAGE]
[SETZER]: Yeah…
She was really something.
[NEWPAGE]
The world could've turned
inside out and she'd never have
even flinched.
--------------------
[SETZER]: Could be anything
lurking down here, so keep
your eyes peeled!
--------------------
Darill: This next test flight
could be dangerous…
--------------------
[SETZER]: Being here brings
back all kinds of memories…
--------------------
[SETZER]: Watch your step.
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]HERE LIES DARILL
--------------------
[SETZER]: What are you trying
to prove by pushing your ship
to its limits? It's pointless!
--------------------
Darill: If the worst should
happen, take care of the Falcon
for me!
--------------------
[SETZER]: You can't be
serious!
[NEWPAGE]
When I take the Falcon from
you, it'll be because I left you a
mile behind in a race!
[NEWPAGE]
Until then, I'm not letting you
out of my sight!
[NEWPAGE]
Darill: Ha! Good luck with that!
--------------------
[SETZER]: Ah, there's really
nothing like flying!
--------------------
[SETZER]: …I can't very well
be the world's fastest pilot if I
can't even fly.
[NEWPAGE]
I need your help… [LONGPAUSE]Falcon!
--------------------
Darill: How long you plan on
hanging back there? Aren't you
gonna try to pass me?
--------------------
Darill: Or are you too entranced
by my lovely behind…?
--------------------
[SETZER]: Incredible.
--------------------
Darill: All right, it's time to get
serious. I'm gonna break the
records!
[NEWPAGE]
I'll fly past the clouds and see
the stars closer than anyone
ever has before!
--------------------
[SETZER]: Be back by sunset!
I'll be waiting for you on our
hill!
--------------------
It was a year later when
I found the wreck of the Falcon
in a distant valley…
--------------------
[SETZER]: I restored the ship,
and then put it to rest down
here.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: So, this is the
Falcon?
--------------------
[EDGAR]: With this, I think
we just might have a chance…
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Now we'll be able
to reach the top of Kefka's
tower!
[NEWPAGE]
[EDGAR]: If we land on top,
we should be able to get inside
to launch our assault.
--------------------
[SETZER]: And we'll be able to
look for the rest of our
friends…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: Right. First things
first. [LONGPAUSE]I'm finally starting to
feel like we have some hope!
--------------------
[CELES]: That bird…
Could it be…?
--------------------
[CELES]: [SETZER]! Follow
that pigeon!
[NEWPAGE]
[SETZER]: …Why?
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: I'm not sure…
But… something inside tells me
it'll lead us to our friends…

To my late friend, I leave an
offering in the far room of
the third basement level…
--------------------
A swordsman passed through
recently. He was clearly quite
skilled, but I could tell his heart
was full of turmoil…
[NEWPAGE]
If he could rid himself of that
confusion and doubt, his
technique would probably reach
a whole new level!
--------------------
I was a thief once. But then I
uncovered a secret so terrible
that I had to go into hiding!
--------------------
I'm an ex-thief. My old partner
always used to mumble,
"To the right of the treasure
[SPACE_07]chest…" in his sleep.
--------------------
I used to be a thief. Out of
desperation, I tried to climb the
Cult of Kefka's tower to steal
their treasure…
[NEWPAGE]
I barely made it out of the
first treasure room alive and
had to turn back.
--------------------
A man with a strange manner
of speech came through town
not long ago. Kept calling
people something funny…
[NEWPAGE]
Thoo…? Tao…? Yow…? [LONGPAUSE]
…Meow?
--------------------
I've learned a lot about how
things stand in this ruined
world from the thieves and
travelers who pass through.
[NEWPAGE]
Want to know where some old
locations moved to?
[NEWPAGE]
[CHOICE] Narshe's new location
[CHOICE] The Veldt's new location
[CHOICE] Doma's new location
[CHOICE] No thanks…
--------------------
You know the guy in Zozo who
says "this place is dangerous"?
[NEWPAGE]
He's the only honest guy in that
town! If you need something
there, he's the one to ask.
--------------------
The sources of people's misery
always lie in their pasts.
[NEWPAGE]
Lost friends, families, and
homelands… Those are the
things that torment people the
most.
--------------------
[CYAN], was it? You wear
the face of a troubled man.
Perhaps a visit home would
help you clear your mind.
--------------------
It sounds like espers can find
love and get married too.
Oh, I wonder if I'll ever find my
own Mr. Right…
--------------------
Lola: Look at all these flowers!
My boyfriend in Mobliz sent
them to me!
[NEWPAGE]
And look! They're all handmade!
Real flowers won't bloom
anymore, so he made me these
from silk!
[NEWPAGE]
And he just sent me this letter!
--------------------
"But… wasn't Mobliz destroyed
[SPACE_07]by Kefka? Someone else must
[SPACE_07]have written that letter…"
--------------------
Read the letter?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
"My beloved Lola,
[SPACE_07]Art thou well? We have rebuilt
[SPACE_07]as much of the village as we
[SPACE_07]could hope to…"
[NEWPAGE]
"I believe I should be able to
[SPACE_07]return to thy side before too
[SPACE_07]long…"
--------------------
This handwriting…
It looks a lot like [CYAN]'s.
…But where is he mailing them
from?
--------------------
Lola: Could you please attach
this reply to the carrier pigeon
outside?
[NEWPAGE]
Send the letter for Lola?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
Lola: Thank you.
--------------------
Lola: Oh, I hope his reply comes
soon!
--------------------
These flowers are made of silk.
Quite beautifully, too…
--------------------
Lola: I knew the letters and
flowers weren't from my
boyfriend. I was just afraid to
admit it.
[NEWPAGE]
I didn't want to accept what
that meant… I was lying to
myself… But it's all right now.
[NEWPAGE]
I don't know who wrote those
letters, but reading them
helped to ease the pain in my
heart.
[NEWPAGE]
I'm sure whoever wrote them
must have suffered the same
kind of pain… [LONGPAUSE]I wish I could
meet him…
--------------------
Actually…
--------------------
[CYAN]: Look to the future.
[NEWPAGE]
No matter how dark it may be,
there will always come another
dawn. And after it, another
day…
--------------------
There's always more light
ahead… [LONGPAUSE]
Thank you. I'll take your words
to heart.
--------------------
[CYAN] replaced the letter
with a different one…
--------------------
[CENTER]Memories of the world before
[CENTER]the fall remain… But the light
[CENTER]of dawn doth never change,
[CENTER]nor e'er the hearts of men…[SPACE_01][PAUSE_1C][SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
[CYAN]!
--------------------
[CYAN]: !!!
Thou art… alive!?
--------------------
[CYAN]…
--------------------
[CYAN]: I shall go with thee!
We must not abandon the world
to Kefka!
[NEWPAGE]
But… however did thou find
me? [LONGPAUSE]W-wait! T-tell me thou did
not read my letters…!
--------------------
[CYAN]: These are… [LONGPAUSE]
They're… [LONGPAUSE]um… [LONGPAUSE]sort of a… [LONGPAUSE]minor
diversion of mine…
--------------------
[CYAN]…
These flowers are gorgeous!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Oh…!
Must thou embarrass me so!?
--------------------
[CYAN]: …Dost thou truly
think so?
--------------------
[CYAN]: I wondered what
had become of that poor girl,
always waiting for word of
her beloved.
[NEWPAGE]
I decided to pay a visit to
Maranda.
[NEWPAGE]
I learned that she had long
since stopped receiving replies,
but still sent a letter each day.
[NEWPAGE]
I could not bear to stand by
and do nothing…
--------------------
[CYAN]: As I wrote to her
I began to realize that I was no
different…
[NEWPAGE]
I was refusing to move on.
I could not let go…
[NEWPAGE]
I will no longer live in the past.
We must all look to the future
now.
--------------------
I encountered Sir [GAU] in
Maranda. He said he "get
strong, smash Kefka!"
[NEWPAGE]
I believe that means he intends
to hone his skills in order to
challenge the lord of the tower.
[NEWPAGE]
Knowing Sir [GAU], he was
probably headed for the Veldt.
--------------------
"Dear Lola,
[SPACE_07]I am writing to beg for your
[SPACE_07]forgiveness. I am guilty of
[SPACE_07]perpetuating a terrible lie."

[NEWPAGE]
"We humans have a tendency to
[SPACE_07]become trapped in the past.
[SPACE_07]I implore you not to let
[SPACE_07]this happen."
[NEWPAGE]
"Now is a time for you to look
[SPACE_07]forward, and rediscover love
[SPACE_07]and all of the other joys of

Not my… very important…!
--------------------

[CYAN]'s treasure chest!
--------------------
A man clad in strange clothing.
…Or perhaps a woman?
Perhaps not even human at all…
--------------------
[GOGO]: I am [GOGO],
master of mimicry.
[NEWPAGE]
It has been a long, long time
since anyone visited me here…
--------------------
[GOGO]: I have been idle for
too many years… Perhaps I
ought to mimic you.
[NEWPAGE]
Tell me, what are you doing
here?
--------------------
[GOGO]: I see…
So, you seek to save the world.
[NEWPAGE]
Then I guess that means that I
shall save the world as well.
Lead on! I will copy your every
move.
--------------------
Are you trying to tell me to
follow you?
--------------------
These wounds are awful…
--------------------
We can't do anything for
wounds like these here…
[NEWPAGE]
Let's fly back to Thamasa on
the double.
--------------------
Must be having a nightmare…
--------------------
All we can do now is wait…
Rest will help.
--------------------
…
--------------------
Hey, how are you feeling?
--------------------
[RELM]: It still hurts a
little… [LONGPAUSE]But I'm okay.
Interceptor's here with me.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: It's only a scratch.
I've had worse. [LONGPAUSE]And I've got
this guy watching over me.
--------------------
When the three of us go
hunting on the Veldt, we always
run across a boy dressed in
hides.
--------------------
You came to try and stop me…
[LONGPAUSE]I'm sorry, but I can't turn back,
boy…
[NEWPAGE]
[LONGPAUSE]Stay here with my daughter…
You both deserve to live in
peace…
--------------------
Daddy…? [LONGPAUSE]
Where'd Daddy go? [LONGPAUSE]
He's coming back… isn't he?
--------------------
For some reason, that boy
never shows up when all four
of us are out there together…
--------------------
They always leave me here so
they can try to befriend that
kid…
[NEWPAGE]
Hmph… I don't wanna go
hunting with them, anyway!
--------------------
There're huge dinosaurs in the
forest north of the Veldt.
They're incredibly strong.
[NEWPAGE]
There's no way a human could
defeat one. But it sure would
be something to brag about if
you did!
--------------------
[LOCKE]!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: You're all safe! [LONGPAUSE]
Behold… The legendary treasure
that can undo death itself…
--------------------
Is that… [LONGPAUSE]magicite?
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: It is.
[NEWPAGE]
Legend says the Phoenix turned
itself to stone ages ago…
It seems the story was true.
[NEWPAGE]
But now it's filled with cracks.
I don't know if it still has the
strength to perform miracles…
--------------------
[CELES]: [LOCKE]…
That's for Rachel, isn't it…?
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Rachel…
I failed her. I broke my
promise and lost the only thing
that was real to me…
[NEWPAGE]
So until I do what I said I'd do…
Until I restore my honor…
…I'm nothing but a no-good
liar.
--------------------
So, you're headed to
Kohlingen…?
--------------------
The village of Kohlingen… [SHORTPAUSE]
--------------------
Old Man: If only it didn't have
all those nasty cracks…
[NEWPAGE]
Don't think it's gonna be calling
back any wayward spirits like
that! Nope, nuh-uh! Too bad,
really… Too bad…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Rachel!
--------------------
Old Man: Gaaah!
The magicite sh-sh-shattered!
--------------------
Rachel: [LOCKE]…

I'm an Imperial soldier! [LONGPAUSE]
Probably the last one alive.
[NEWPAGE]
I passed along a secret to that
friend of yours with the
bandana… "Talk to the emperor
twice."
[NEWPAGE]
It's a hint to finding the place
where Emperor Gestahl hid
some legendary treasure.
No idea what it means…
--------------------
Rachel: [LOCKE]…
Oh, how I've wanted to see
you… to talk to you…!
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Rachel…
[NEWPAGE]
Rachel: The Phoenix used the
last of its power to give me
some time… But I must leave
again soon…
[NEWPAGE]
Before my time is gone…
There's something I must tell
you… Something I never had a
chance to say…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: …
[NEWPAGE]
Rachel: [LOCKE]… [LONGPAUSE]… [LONGPAUSE]
You made me so happy…
[NEWPAGE]
In my last moments, my
memory returned… I drifted
off thinking of you, and I was
truly, [LONGPAUSE]truly happy…
[NEWPAGE]
So let me now say the words I
never had the chance to say… [LONGPAUSE]
[LOCKE]… Thank you.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Rachel!
[NEWPAGE]
Rachel: I have to go now… [LONGPAUSE]
But thank you so much for all
the happiness you've given me…
[NEWPAGE]
Please, let go of the chains that
bind your heart… [LONGPAUSE]
I release you…
[NEWPAGE]
Give your love to the one who
now dwells within your heart…
Love her… as you loved me…
[NEWPAGE]
Phoenix… [LONGPAUSE]Be reborn!
And give your power to
[LOCKE]!

This is the Jidoor Auction
House. It's always full of
wealthy aristocrats.
--------------------
Yay! Now I can go play at the
art collector's house again!
--------------------
Every once in a while,
something rare comes up for
auction. You just have to keep
your eyes peeled!
--------------------
The house on the northern end
of town belongs to Owzer. He's
an art collector with a taste
for fine paintings.
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]A beautiful still life of flowers.

--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]A picture of a lovely lady.
--------------------
Owzer found a skilled young
artist and brought her back to
his mansion to paint for him.
--------------------
I saw Emperor Gestahl the
other day! [LONGPAUSE]…Well, at least a
painting of him.
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer has it hanging up in his
house. I must say, it's a perfect
likeness!
--------------------
There are a lot of opera fans in
this town.
--------------------
I've seen a lot of carrier
pigeons flying towards Maranda
lately. I wonder who's sending
all those letters?
--------------------
I read Owzer's diary the last
time I was at his house.
Tee-hee!
[NEWPAGE]
I mean, it was just lying there!
What else was I supposed to
do?
--------------------
I saw a little girl go into the
art collector's house not too
long ago.
--------------------
Oh, so it wasn't a ghost after
all!
--------------------
There's something I need to
talk to Owzer about, but I can't
find him anywhere!
--------------------
Of course, the world map's a
lot different now…

[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Emperor's Letter!
[NEWPAGE]
The letter reads as follows:
[NEWPAGE]
[CENTER]The legendary treasure
[CENTER]sleeps where the mountains
[CENTER]form a star…
--------------------
[RELM]: Aren't you going to
take the stone?
--------------------
This one looks awfully

Just spent an absolute fortune
on a new painting.
[NEWPAGE]
It's quite a large one, so I
won't be able to put it on the
first floor with the others.
[NEWPAGE]
I'll have to think about where
to display it later.
--------------------
An artist came from Zozo
today. Showed me his "work".
What a waste of time.
--------------------
Lamp on the stairwell was
broken, so I bought a new one
at the item shop.
[NEWPAGE]
'Twas a tad pricey, but now
everything's all bright and
cheery with just a flip of the
switch.
--------------------
I invited an artist here from
Kohlingen. Skills weren't quite
up to par…
[NEWPAGE]
I guess it's asking too much to
expect a painter to have more
talent than a wet sponge.
--------------------
I've been feeling strange lately.
Ever since I had that picture
painted…
[NEWPAGE]
I've been hearing things, too.
Strange sounds. They seem to
be coming from the cellar.
--------------------
The diary ends here…
--------------------
Owzer: [RELM]…
Please, come back soon…

Owzer: P-please… [LONGPAUSE]
Help the painting…
[NEWPAGE]
…The painting!?
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: There's… There's a
monster possessing my prized
goddess painting…
[NEWPAGE]
…A monster!?
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: Yes… It hides in the
painting. It won't show itself…
--------------------
Chadarnook: Gwa-ha-ha-ha… [LONGPAUSE]
Try to get between me and my
prize, will you…?
[NEWPAGE]
This painting's the best I've had
in a long time… No one's
denying me this treat!
--------------------
Owzer: No! You can't! You
mustn't harm my precious
goddess painting! Only the
monster!
--------------------
[RELM]: Eek!
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: [RELM]! You mustn't
attack the picture of the
goddess! It'll only make
matters worse!
--------------------
[RELM]: Hey! You can relax
now! That monster's not gonna
be possessing any more
paintings.
--------------------
Owzer: Oh, thank you…
That picture's worth more to
me than my own life!
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: …Really?
--------------------
So… what is [RELM] doing
here, anyway?
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: I bought that painting
at the auction house. But
before long, it began to turn
darker and darker.
[NEWPAGE]
I'd never seen anything like it
before. I had a few different
painters try to fix it for me,
but nothing really worked.
[NEWPAGE]
It was right around that time
that I heard about [RELM].
I brought her straight here and
set her to work.
[NEWPAGE]
I guess it was that monster
that caused the painting to
darken after all…
--------------------
Where's the stone now?
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: Oh, the stone? [LONGPAUSE]
It's over in that bookcase.
--------------------
Owzer: Hey, not that!
That's almost as precious to me
as life itself!
[NEWPAGE]
But you did help me…
I guess I'll give you that too.
--------------------
This is magicite…
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: Whatever it is, I sure
don't need it anymore. If you
want it, you can have it!
--------------------
Owzer: The stone's in that
bookcase over there.
--------------------
I stumbled across something
incredible: Deathgaze's little
secret! He can't recover his
health after battle!
[NEWPAGE]
If you just keep fighting him
over and over, you should be
able to wear him down and
eventually defeat him.
--------------------
First time I've been here…
Doesn't look like the kinda place
a down-and-out bum like me
belongs!
--------------------
Okay! [LONGPAUSE]Here's our next item up
for bid!
--------------------
…this PuPu magicite!

Take it away, please!

Let's go home.
[NEWPAGE]

--------------------
Well, that's all for today!
Come back again soon!

Oh, how could I say no to those
cute little eyes? Ho-ho-ho…

Are you all right, old man!?
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: You really think things
will return to the way they
were?
[NEWPAGE]
"…No one knows. But… if we
[SPACE_07]don't do anything, the world's
[SPACE_07]fate is sealed…"
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: It'll be the end of
everything…
[NEWPAGE]
"We don't have much time.
[SPACE_07]We need [RELM]'s help…"
--------------------
Owzer: Then, let me hug her… [LONGPAUSE]
just one last time…
--------------------
Owzer: [RELM]… [LONGPAUSE]
*cough* *hack*
Will you come back someday?
[NEWPAGE]
And… paint for me again?
--------------------
[RELM]: You bet!
[NEWPAGE]
Owzer: All right, then…
Such a nice girl…
--------------------
[RELM]: I have to go now.
But don't you worry! I'll be
back to finish this painting!

That guy's gotta be your dad!

Oowa-gau!

Let's go tell him!
[NEWPAGE]
He needs to know you're his

--------------------
[SABIN]: Wait a minute…
This is a once-in-a-lifetime

[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: We should at least
dress you up a bit! Let's go to
Jidoor and get you spiffed up!

Oh, but I liked those other ones
so much, too…!
[NEWPAGE]
*mumble* …everything you
liked… boy wouldn't even be
able to move…

[TERRA]: What was that!?
[NEWPAGE]
N-nothing! Didn't say a thing!
…Whew. That was close…

I guess we'll have to go with a
bandana on his head after all.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: A bandana?
I thought we were trying to
make him
look presentable!
[NEWPAGE]
Guess we all know better than
to expect any sort of class out
of [LOCKE], though…

Why don't you try saying that

[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Sir…
You had a son… right?
You did, didn't you?

Aged Man: …A son?
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Yes.
You see, sir… he's alive.
…[GAU], speak up!

[GAU]: Fa-ther…
--------------------
Aged Man: Huh? What? What's
all this business about a son?
I don't have a son!
--------------------
Aged Man: But now that you
mention it, I once had a terrible
dream… [LONGPAUSE]A dream in which some
kind of demon child was born.
[NEWPAGE]
I grabbed the thing and rushed
off to the Veldt with it… [LONGPAUSE]Thing
was crying like crazy by the
time I got there…
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: But, sir…!
--------------------
Aged Man: I left the child
there… [LONGPAUSE]And then I turned
around and ran, trying not to
look back…
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: I'm trying to tell
you…
--------------------
Aged Man: Then all of a sudden
the crying stopped. I turned
around…
[NEWPAGE]
…and there was some frightful
monster! Never seen anything
like it…
[NEWPAGE]
Hideous! Still gives me the
shakes when I think about it…
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: I give up…
This guy's hopeless…
--------------------
Aged Man: But you, young man…
Your parents must be proud to
have such a fine son!
[NEWPAGE]
I still dream about being chased
by that demon child…
Terrifying, those dreams…
--------------------
[SABIN]: Why you old…!

Running your mouth, not even
so much as thinking about

wants to talk about these days!
[NEWPAGE]
"Pardon?"
[NEWPAGE]
Aged Man: Little while back,
another repairman wearing a
bandana came here asking the
same thing… So I told him!
[NEWPAGE]
"Then… where is it!?"
--------------------
Aged Man: It's where the
mountains form a shape like a
star…
[NEWPAGE]
Sheesh! Why didn't you just ask
me from the beginning?
No need to be so shy!

Aged Man: Got it? Where the

[NEWPAGE]
What in the world happened?
--------------------
I am Gungho, Thamasa's most
renowned monster hunter.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: G-Gungho!?
--------------------
If you're looking for that man
who was dressed all in black,
he already left. He said he was
going to the coliseum.
--------------------
One day not long ago, a man
came here saying he worked
for an aristocrat in Jidoor, and
left with that little girl!
--------------------
I saw a huge monster fly
across the sky. It looked like a
giant bat!
--------------------
There aren't any good places
left to play.
--------------------
Ebot's Rock is above water for
the first time in fifty years.
Head north of town and you
should be able to see it!
--------------------
Gungho: Oh, [STRAGO]!
Have you come back to hunt
Hidon?
--------------------
Seems you're letting [STRAGO]
fight with you, but I should
warn you… the man's a
monumental coward.
--------------------
Gungho: You haven't changed a
bit, have you?
--------------------
Back when you were young,
you tried so hard to hunt down
Hidon… but then you gave up
and quit before you found him.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: I didn't quit!
It's just… I sort of… I mean…
[NEWPAGE]
The thing lives in Ebot's Rock,
and after the place sunk, well…
[NEWPAGE]
Gungho: Always have to make
excuses, don't you?
--------------------
Gungho: You're pathetic!
--------------------
Mayor: It's hard to believe it's
only been a year since the
cataclysm… It feels like it's
been ages.
--------------------
[RELM]: Yay, we're home!
I'll be in the house, okay?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: So full of energy! [LONGPAUSE]
I must be the only one getting
old…
--------------------
[RELM]: You've gotta come
quick! Gungho's hurt!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Gungho, hang in
there!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Who did this to
you?
[NEWPAGE]
Gungho: It was Hidon, that
legendary beast you and I used
to hunt… Almost had him, too…
--------------------
Gungho: Oooh… *cough*
*wheeze*
--------------------
Gungho: [STRAGO]…
Please… avenge me…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Hidon!?
--------------------
[RELM]: Grandpa!
What are you standing around
for!?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: You're right…
[NEWPAGE]
I grew old and stopped even
thinking about pursuing the
dreams of my youth…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Gungho, I'm going
after him!
--------------------
[RELM]: Grandpa, wait!
You're not thinking of going all
alone, are you?
--------------------
[STRAGO]: …I need to face the
thing I ran from all those years
ago. I need to get the best of
it.
[NEWPAGE]
It's a matter of pride, dear.
--------------------
[RELM]: It's a matter of you
being a stubborn old man!
[NEWPAGE]
You're my grandpa!
[NEWPAGE]
I can't just sit and watch while
you make things harder for
yourself than they have to be!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: I'm sorry,
[RELM]… It means a lot to
me that you care so much.
[NEWPAGE]
…But Hidon's a tough beast to
track. Its name comes from the
old word for "hidden", after
all!
[NEWPAGE]
No one'll ever find him if I
don't go.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: To Ebot's Rock!
--------------------
[RELM]: Phew…
--------------------
Chest: I'm hungry!
[NEWPAGE]
Hungry hungry hungry
hungry hungry hungry
hungry hungry hungry!
[NEWPAGE]

how are your wounds healing,
Gungho?
--------------------
Gungho: Hmm? [LONGPAUSE]Oh, my wounds!
Yes, they're fine…
--------------------
That evening…
--------------------
[STRAGO]: So there I was,
creeping through those caves
that seemed to go on forever…
[NEWPAGE]
I finally reach the deepest,
darkest cavern, and there he
is, right in front of me!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: I stared the ugly
brute straight in the eye,
raised my staff, and let him
have it!
[NEWPAGE]
Bam!
[NEWPAGE]
Thwack!
[NEWPAGE]
Pow!
[NEWPAGE]

--------------------
[RELM]: Where's Grandpa?
[NEWPAGE]
Gungho: Hmm? [LONGPAUSE]Oh,
I think he finally tired himself
out from all that jabbering and
nodded off.
--------------------
Gungho: But… [LONGPAUSE]do you think it's
okay to leave it like this, with
him thinking I was really hurt?
--------------------
[RELM]: Don't worry about
it!
[NEWPAGE]
If we hadn't tricked him, he'd
have spent the rest of his life
doing nothing but talk.
[NEWPAGE]
And even if you were faking,
that monster wasn't!
--------------------
Gungho: I don't know how a
man like him ever managed to
raise a granddaughter as
wonderful as you…
[NEWPAGE]
[RELM]: Yeah? Well, I don't
know how anyone could be as
terrible an actor as you!
--------------------
[RELM]: [STRAGO] is
probably the only man alive
who would fall for a
performance like that!
--------------------
Gungho: How've you been?
Everything okay?
--------------------
Gungho: I heard someone saw
Hidon at Ebot's Rock again!
--------------------
I've been traveling all over the
world since the cataclysm last
year. I've seen all sorts of
things!
[NEWPAGE]
Wanna hear something neat?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
There's a small, triangular
island to the northeast of the
Veldt.
--------------------
That island is home to a
monster that sucks in anything
unfortunate enough to go near
it.
[NEWPAGE]
Wonder what would happen if
you got sucked into it? [LONGPAUSE]
…Yuck, I don't even want to
think about that!
--------------------
Gungho: What did you say!?

This is Figaro, the desert castle.
--------------------
Halt!
--------------------
…Oh, it's you. Proceed.
--------------------
Figaro has an alliance with the
Empire.
--------------------
Figaro Castle is the most
advanced structure in the
world!
--------------------
You wouldn't know by looking
at it, but this castle is loaded
with advanced technology.
For example…
--------------------
Whoops!
Heh… It's all top-secret!
--------------------
You saw it, didn't you?
--------------------
Hmmm…? [PAUSE_01] Is that…? [PAUSE_01]Hey!!!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: It's not safe here.
We'd better hightail it south to
Figaro!
--------------------
Biggs: So… this is the frozen
esper?
--------------------
Narshe Guard: We're not
handing over the esper!
--------------------
Narshe Guard: Ymir! Get them!
--------------------
What are you doing here?
Scram!
--------------------
Get back to your post.
--------------------
Oh, is my shift up already?
Great! I'll go take a break.
--------------------
I'm not buying anything!
--------------------
This location is under Imperial
occupation.
--------------------
A detachment should be making
its way toward Narshe as we
speak. We'll be linking up with
them soon.
--------------------
That idiot, Kefka, is about to
invade Narshe. …Oh, of course I
know better than to call him
that to his face!
--------------------
Duncan's Wife: Rich people's
homes always have secret

Merchant: …You!
You're that infamous thief,

hunter… and don't you forget
it!
--------------------
Merchant: Why do I always
have to go and open my

--------------------
Merchant: I'm sorry, I just ran
out of everything I had to sell!
[CHOICE] Lie to me will you!? Let's go!
[CHOICE] Guess I'm out of luck…
--------------------
Merchant: Business has slowed
to a crawl thanks to the
Empire.
--------------------
Peace has returned, but I fear
my husband is gone forever…
--------------------
You say you really managed to
make peace with the Empire?
--------------------
We're free!

[TERRA]: General Leo…
I think I've begun to
understand the things you told
me…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: As long as there are
people who need to be
protected, I'll keep on fighting!
--------------------
[CYAN]: What an intriguing
apparatus!
--------------------
[SHADOW]: …
--------------------
[EDGAR]: If something were
to happen to me, all the world's
ladies would grieve!
--------------------
[SABIN]: All right!
Let's do this!
--------------------
[CELES]: As long as we don't
give up hope, there's still a
chance for the future!
--------------------
[STRAGO]: All of you have that
sparkle in your eyes… Well, this
old man's not giving up, either!
--------------------
[RELM]: Come on! Let's go
knock the crazy right out

--------------------
[SETZER]: I think luck is on

--------------------
It dropped something!
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Deathgaze Claw!
--------------------
[EDGAR]: It's time we took
the battle to Kefka's doorstep!
--------------------
[SETZER]: What's wrong?
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: …
--------------------
[CELES]: The gods of the
Warring Triad control the
magic of the Esper Realm…
[NEWPAGE]
If we destroy them…
--------------------
[EDGAR]: …You're worried
about what might happen?
--------------------
[CELES]: I'm not sure, but…
--------------------
[CELES]: …espers and magic
might vanish from the world
entirely.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: Espers… and even
magic itself could vanish from
the world.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: And if that
happens…
--------------------
[CELES]: …what'll happen to
[TERRA]?
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Welcome, friends!
--------------------
[CENTER]I knew you'd come,
[CENTER]so I spent great effort
[CENTER]coming up with a suitable
[CENTER]greeting for you!
--------------------
How much do you have to
destroy before you'll have had
your fill, Kefka!?
[NEWPAGE]
Kefka: I've acquired the
ultimate power!
Observe…
--------------------
Kefka: Such incredible power!
You're nothing more than fleas
compared to me now!
--------------------
Kefka: Embrace your
destruction… It is the fate of
all things.
--------------------
To be destroyed? Maybe it is!
But people can always rebuild,
and new lives will always be
born!
--------------------
Kefka: And time will destroy all
those as well.
[NEWPAGE]
Why do people insist on
creating things that will
inevitably be destroyed?
[NEWPAGE]
Why do people cling to life,
knowing that they must
someday die?
[NEWPAGE]
…Knowing that none of it will
have meant anything once they
do?
--------------------
Because it's not the end that
matters! It's knowing you have
something to live for right now,
at this moment!
[NEWPAGE]
Something you've worked for…
Something that's worth
protecting!
--------------------
As long as you have that…
that's enough!
--------------------
Kefka: And did you all find your
"somethings" in this broken
world that just won't die?
--------------------
Yes!
--------------------
[TERRA]: Love!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: A person worth
protecting.
--------------------
[CYAN]: A wife and child
who live on within me.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: Friends… and
family.
--------------------
[EDGAR]: A peaceful kingdom.
--------------------
[SABIN]: A loving brother
who always looks out for me!
Gah-ha-ha-ha!
--------------------
[CELES]: Someone willing to
accept me for who I am.
--------------------
[STRAGO]: An adorable little
granddaughter.
--------------------
[RELM]: An obnoxious
grandpa… who I couldn't live
without!
--------------------
[SETZER]: Wings from a dear
old friend!
--------------------
[MOG]: New pals, kupo!
--------------------
[GAU]: These people!
All them! Uwaooo!
--------------------
Kefka: Bleh! You people make
me sick! You sound like lines
from a self-help book!
--------------------
Kefka: If that's how it's going
to be… I'll snuff them all out!
[NEWPAGE]
Every last one of your
sickening, happy little reasons
for living!
--------------------
No! Kefka, stop!
--------------------
Kefka: I wield the greatest
power in existence!
[NEWPAGE]
You may as well be the dirt on
the bottom of my boots!
Or the dirt stuck to the bottom
of that dirt!
--------------------
Kefka: I'll destroy everything!
[NEWPAGE]
I'll create my own empire…
of death!
--------------------
You can't destroy everything!
[NEWPAGE]
People will always have
dreams!
--------------------
Kefka: No! I'll destroy the
entire world!
[NEWPAGE]
There won't be anything left to
dream about!
--------------------
We won't let you hurt any more
people!
--------------------
Kefka: Hee-hee-hee!
[NEWPAGE]
But what fun is destruction if
no "precious" lives are lost?
--------------------
It ends here, Kefka!
--------------------
Kefka: Oh, all right… if you
insist! I'll end it here.
I'll end everything!
[NEWPAGE]
Your lives can be the first!

The tower's collapsing!

There's no time to lose!

[EDGAR]: If espers are
fading from the world now…
--------------------
[TERRA]: Come with me.
I can use the last of my power
to guide you out.

Banon: During the War of the
Magi, a band of heroes wielded
twelve legendary weapons.
[NEWPAGE]
Legend has it those weapons
are still housed in a castle
somewhere…
--------------------
Banon: The entrance to the
Esper Realm is blocked by the
Sealed Gate.
[NEWPAGE]
The path to the gate was
supposedly destroyed during
the great cataclysm, but I find
that hard to believe.
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: The Sealed Gate and the
cave leading to it were both
created from the espers'
power…
[NEWPAGE]
If we had the power of the
Warring Triad, it might be
possible to reach the Esper
Realm again.
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: This certainly warrants
further investigation, if you
ask me…
--------------------
Thank you.

Welcome to the Soul Shrine.
[NEWPAGE]
This is a place where evil souls

Brrr! It's so cold!
We're liable to freeze unless

Narshe Guard: On my honor, I

I met a soldier from Doma the

headed back to his homeland…
--------------------
Over 100 twisted souls haunt
the walls of this unhallowed

[NEWPAGE]
Once the battle begins, they will
attack you relentlessly, one

[NEWPAGE]
And should you leave the shrine
even once, any defeated souls
will rise again. They do not stay
at rest for long…

It will be a very long and

make sure you are prepared.

If we could somehow harness
it…

as summoners would call upon
the espers to lend them their
power.

later… Such foolish, ceaseless
conflict.
[NEWPAGE]
Esper: Do you have the strength
to break the cycle of this war?
I must test you to know for
certain…
--------------------
[CYAN]: During my training
atop Mt. Zozo, I spied a most
unusual light.
[NEWPAGE]
[CYAN]: Thinking that I had
dreamt it, I brushed it aside at
the time. But perhaps it is
precisely what we seek now?
--------------------
[CYAN]: So you're Kefka,
you cur!?
[NEWPAGE]
[LONGPAUSE]You murdered the people of
Doma. Now it is my turn… [LONGPAUSE]
for vengeance!
--------------------
Gilgamesh: You guys wanna get
to the top of this building?
[NEWPAGE]
"Yes."
"We're looking for someone."
[NEWPAGE]
Gilgamesh: Well, too bad!
This is the end of the line for
you!
[NEWPAGE]
"Wait!"
"We haven't done anything--"
[NEWPAGE]
Gilgamesh: All right! [LONGPAUSE]
It's go time!
--------------------
"Wait! You were on the
[SPACE_07]Phantom Train…!"
[NEWPAGE]
Gilgamesh: Oh! [LONGPAUSE]
What a surprise little reunion! [LONGPAUSE]
So, what brings you here?
--------------------
"We're too big…"
"We can't possibly fit."
"Maybe we can try turning into
[SPACE_07]toads or something…"
--------------------
"Oh! Now we can fit!"
"All ribbit! Err, I mean
[SPACE_07]'right'."
--------------------
Gilgamesh: Oh! [LONGPAUSE]It's you!
[NEWPAGE]
"Not you again…"
[NEWPAGE]
Gilgamesh: You bested me back
in Zozo, but only 'cause you got
lucky. It won't happen again
this time!
[NEWPAGE]
Gilgamesh: Prepare to fall
before my warrior training! [LONGPAUSE]
It's fightin' time!
--------------------
Gestahl: That's enough, Kefka.
--------------------
[CELES]: What's going on?
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: I'm guessing my
brother has an idea of his
own in mind…
--------------------
T-take this…
--------------------
Duncan: But first…
--------------------
[SABIN]: !! [LONGPAUSE]Vargas…!?
--------------------
Vargas: [SABIN]… I'm sorry. [LONGPAUSE]
I know this won't right my
wrongdoings, but…
--------------------
Vargas: Our master's special
technique… [LONGPAUSE]
I want to help you master it,
if that's okay with you.
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Vargas… [LONGPAUSE]I accept!
--------------------
Duncan: Prove that you have
the strength to defeat this
foolish son of mine!
[NEWPAGE]
Vargas: Prepare yourself!
--------------------
Vargas: As impressive as
always, [SABIN]…!
[NEWPAGE]
[SABIN]: Vargas… [LONGPAUSE]
You were even more
impressive!
--------------------
Duncan: That's enough! [LONGPAUSE]
You've grown so very strong,
[SABIN].
--------------------
Duncan: All right! Let's do it!
--------------------
Vargas: I'm going to stay here
and keep training with the old
man, just like in the old days.
--------------------
Welcome to the realm of
dreams!
--------------------
Pleasure to meet you! [LONGPAUSE]
We're the Magus Sisters,
the rulers of dreams.
--------------------
I am Sandy!
--------------------
I'm Cindy!
--------------------
And I'm Mindy!
--------------------
So sorry, but this is the end of
the line for you.
--------------------
This man's mind…
--------------------
…will be ours!
--------------------
"[CYAN]…?"
--------------------
Esper: I thank you for
defeating Wrexsoul…
[NEWPAGE]
Esper: I am known as Diabolos…
[LONGPAUSE]As an esper, I preside over
dreams.
[NEWPAGE]
Esper: Now, then. Let us see if
you are worthy of handling
my power…
--------------------
The magical power that
enveloped the tower has
disappeared!
--------------------
"!!" [LONGPAUSE]
"No… [LONGPAUSE]It can't be…"
--------------------
"General Leo!"
--------------------
The former General Leo
standing before you [LONGPAUSE]lives again
through the power of Magitek…
[LONGPAUSE]…as an animated corpse!
--------------------
"Kefka…!" [LONGPAUSE]
"Is our only choice to fight
[SPACE_07]him!?"
--------------------
[TERRA]: !! [LONGPAUSE]
No… [LONGPAUSE]It can't be…
--------------------
[TERRA]: General Leo!
--------------------
[TERRA] No… [LONGPAUSE]
Is our only choice to fight him!?
--------------------
[TERRA]: Wait! [LONGPAUSE]
I still wanted to ask you--!
--------------------
"Damn it!"
"Kefka… You WILL pay for
[SPACE_07]this!"
--------------------
[CENTER]I thank you…… [LONGPAUSE]
[CENTER]And I apologize…… [LONGPAUSE]
[CENTER]I leave the world…… [LONGPAUSE]
[CENTER]in your hands……
--------------------
[TERRA]: …Oh!
This is General Leo's…
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Seydlitz!
--------------------
[TERRA]: … [LONGPAUSE]… [LONGPAUSE]
We WILL [LONGPAUSE]stop Kefka. [LONGPAUSE]
I swear it!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: … [LONGPAUSE]… [LONGPAUSE]
I don't feel ready to hit the hay
yet…
--------------------
We depart early tomorrow
morning. You should get some
rest at the inn.
--------------------
Even with the war over, the
things we lost will never come
back.…
--------------------
Up until now, soldiers would
yell at us just for being outside
this late.
--------------------
Welcome. Please enjoy your
stay.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: … [LONGPAUSE]Not drinking?
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: I'm terrible at
holding my liquor.
[NEWPAGE]
[SHADOW]: … [LONGPAUSE]I was the same
way too, once…
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Have you seen
[CELES]?
[NEWPAGE]
[SHADOW]: She hasn't been
by here. [LONGPAUSE]Maybe try asking
around the docks.
--------------------
[SHADOW]: … …
--------------------
General [CELES]?
General Leo might know where
she is. He's at the docks.
--------------------
Leo: You're up rather late.
Is something the matter?
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: I'm just… [LONGPAUSE]
having trouble sleeping.
[NEWPAGE]
Leo: Hahaha… [LONGPAUSE]Same here.
[NEWPAGE]
Leo: The espers' power was
unbelievable. We'll need to do
something if we want to avoid
a repeat of that destruction.
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Yeah… [LONGPAUSE]
We'll figure something out. [LONGPAUSE]
I have no doubt about it.
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: By the way, have
you seen [CELES]…?
[NEWPAGE]
Leo: Oh, General [CELES]
went into town a few minutes
ago to enjoy the evening
breeze.
[NEWPAGE]
Leo: … [LONGPAUSE]She's known far and
wide as the "Invincible General"
and such, but in truth, she's a
strong woman before all else.
[NEWPAGE]
Leo: Give her all the support
you can.
--------------------
Leo: Hahaha… [LONGPAUSE]
I'm counting on you.
--------------------
[CYAN]: You…!
--------------------
You're too late!
Watch and suffer!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Grgh! Curse you!
--------------------
Go forth, my servants!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Sorrow… [LONGPAUSE]Anger… [LONGPAUSE]
Hate… [LONGPAUSE][LONGPAUSE]
How could I let this happen to
me…?
--------------------
But it is those very same
emotions [LONGPAUSE]that allow people to
grow stronger.
--------------------
My daddy won't lose to you!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Elayne… [LONGPAUSE]Owain…!
--------------------
[CYAN]: Is everyone
unharmed!? My cowardice put
you in danger as well…!
--------------------
Ha ha ha… [LONGPAUSE]
Eternal happiness could have
been yours had you stayed in
this dream realm…
[NEWPAGE]
Now, however, you shall
become a part of me!
--------------------
Molulu: Oh, [MOG]! [LONGPAUSE]
How's it going, kupo?
[NEWPAGE]
[MOG]: I'm good, kupo!
And with [UMARO] here,
I have nothing to worry about,
kupo!
[NEWPAGE]
[UMARO]: Oo… [LONGPAUSE]
[UMARO], protect boss! Oo!
[NEWPAGE]
Molulu: Great to hear, kupo! [LONGPAUSE]
Take this token of my gratitude
with you, kupo!
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Molulu's Charm!
--------------------
Cid: I want to repair our house,
but a flying monster called
Deathgaze keeps just wrecking
everything all over again.
--------------------
Cid: With Deathgaze out of the
picture, I was finally able to fix
the house. Thank you!
--------------------
[CELES]: Granddad!
How are you? Well, I hope?
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: Oh, [CELES].
It's good to have you back.
I'm quite well now, thanks to
you!
[NEWPAGE]
[CELES]: Hee hee. I'm glad. [LONGPAUSE]
Oh, yes. I have someone I'd like
you to meet, Granddad.
--------------------
Cid: You're… [LONGPAUSE]That Returner…? [LONGPAUSE]
Ah, I thought I recognized you.
The last time we met was at
the banquet, as I recall.
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Yes, thank you
for all of your help back then. [LONGPAUSE]
It's good to see you again.
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: Come. You're both
welcome to stay here tonight. [LONGPAUSE]
I'll even cook up some delicious
fish!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: Here you are.
--------------------
[CELES]: [LOCKE]…
--------------------
[CELES]: When I finally
woke up after the cataclysm,
Granddad and I were the only
ones on this island.
--------------------
[CELES]: All of the others
had already thrown themselves
off of this cliff…
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: … … [LONGPAUSE]
Yeah, the old man told me
about it…
--------------------
[CELES]: But… I'm still alive
now, thanks to our friends. [LONGPAUSE]
Thanks to you…
--------------------
[LOCKE]: [CELES]…
--------------------
[CELES]: Thank you… [LONGPAUSE]
[LOCKE].
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I feel the same
way.
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: Protecting the
world, [LONGPAUSE]and keeping you safe… [LONGPAUSE]
That's my dream now.
That's all that matters to me.
--------------------
[LOCKE]: After all, how
can I call myself a treasure
hunter [LONGPAUSE]if I don't even have a
dream to chase!?
--------------------
[CELES]: "Treasure hunter"?
That's just a funny way of
saying "thief"!
--------------------
[LOCKE]: I brought some
of those flowers [CYAN]
made.
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: We need to live
life as best as we can. Not just
for ourselves, but for
everyone who's gone too.
--------------------
[CELES]: Thank you,
Granddad. [LONGPAUSE]We had a wonderful
time.
[NEWPAGE]
[LOCKE]: And some tasty
fish!
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: Hahaha… [LONGPAUSE]Please, feel free
to visit any time.
[NEWPAGE]
Cid: Oh, yes.
This is for you, [CELES].
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Tynar Rouge!
--------------------
Cid: Don't get into too much
danger, you two. I expect you
both to come back alive!
--------------------
Cid: Don't get into too much
danger. I expect you to come
back alive!
--------------------
After the tower's weird energy
disappeared, the sound of a
dragon's cry started coming
from up above.
--------------------
This tower used to be home to
the Cult of Kefka. I wonder
what happened to the treasure
on the top floor…
[NEWPAGE]
Before, people could only use
magic inside. But thanks to you
guys, now we non-magic users
can go up it too!
--------------------
Want some top-secret info?
It's different from last time.
[CHOICE] Yes, please.
[CHOICE] Nope
--------------------
Apparently, the last living flying
dragon landed on top of the
tower.
[NEWPAGE]
I bet something cool would
happen if you could tame it
somehow.
[NEWPAGE]
I've heard that flying dragons
love the food that Mobliz is
famous for!
--------------------
Even with that weird magic
energy gone, the tower is still
crawling with monsters.
--------------------
Have you seen the flying
dragon on top of the tower?
It sure is friendly.
[NEWPAGE]
Maybe I should quit my job as a
bandit and take good care of it
instead…
--------------------
If it weren't for all the
monsters, it'd be a cinch to
reach that flying dragon.
--------------------
Thank you.
After you defeated the
tower's guardian, I regained
control of my mind.
--------------------
Kefka was controlling us with
his magic, so that we would
worship him.
--------------------
Even though we were being
controlled, it's scary to think
we built this huge, creepy
tower…
[NEWPAGE]
I guess it goes to show how
weak-minded we were.
--------------------
Espers are believed to still
dwell beyond the Sealed Gate.
[NEWPAGE]
I'm pretty sure the path
leading there was destroyed
during the cataclysm, but who
knows…
--------------------
When the world came to an
end, I swear I woke up in a
village full of espers.
[NEWPAGE]
Everyone tells me it must've
just been a dream I had, but I
really don't think it was…
--------------------
"What the…!?"
"A flying dragon? But didn't
[SPACE_07]they all go extinct?"
--------------------
"You're giving this to us…?"
"Thank you!"
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Dragon Horn!
--------------------
Ride the dragon down the
tower?
[CHOICE] Yes
[CHOICE] No
--------------------
"Thank you!"
"All right! Let's go!"
--------------------
I need to earn money to feed
the flying dragon!
--------------------
Buy something, will 'ya?
We all worked hard to make
this stuff!
--------------------
"!!"
--------------------
INTRUDERS DETECTED.
COMMENCING ERADICATION.
--------------------
Pay off Ultros' debt for him?
[CHOICE] No. No, no, no!
[CHOICE] Die, you spoony debt!
--------------------
Ultros: Wha-- [LONGPAUSE]For real?
Really real??
[NEWPAGE]
"You're in a bind, right?"
"It's already a tough world to
[SPACE_07]survive in."
[NEWPAGE]
"We need to help each other
[SPACE_07]however we can."
[NEWPAGE]
Ultros: Wha-- [LONGPAUSE]Buh-- [LONGPAUSE]
No one's ever been so nice to
squirmy ol' me…
[NEWPAGE]
I WILL repay this favor
someday. And you can take that
to the bank!
--------------------
Ultros: My debt's finally paid
off, but there's still Master
Typhon's debt to pay.
[NEWPAGE]
I'm gonna be stuck here
forever… [LONGPAUSE]Heh.
[NEWPAGE]
Oh, yeah. [LONGPAUSE]Just as a heads-up,
don't bother betting junk items.
Otherwise Master Typhon'll
hafta teach you a lesson!
--------------------
Fiend: To think that you could
defeat us…
--------------------
Demon: Well done, children of
man.
--------------------
Goddess: We, the Warring Triad,
entrust our power to you…
--------------------
"The three gods of magic…"
"The Warring Triad…"
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]We do not wish for our power
[CENTER]to again ruin this world…
[NEWPAGE]
 
[CENTER]Humans and espers…
[CENTER]Save them both…
--------------------
[SPACE_01]
[CENTER]Obtained Jihad magicite!
--------------------
"Even the Warring Triad have
[SPACE_07]turned into magicite…"
"We should go tell Banon."
--------------------
Banon: I hear the cave leading
to the Sealed Gate is
connected to the cave leading
to the ancient castle.
[NEWPAGE]
I leave the investigation to you!
--------------------
I assume [TERRA]'s power
will be needed to get there…
--------------------
"Banon…"
"The Warring Triad lost their
[SPACE_07]power and turned into
[SPACE_07]magicite."
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: The Warring Triad did…?
[LONGPAUSE]Curse that, Kefka… Stripping
the gods of their power and
taking it for himself…
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: As I mentioned before,
the Sealed Gate blocks the
entrance to the Esper Realm.
[NEWPAGE]
Banon: However, it seems the
path leading to the gate is still
intact.
--------------------
Esper: My name is Carbuncle.
You're the ones who saved me
from that lab, yes? Thank you.
[NEWPAGE]
"The magicite we found at the
[SPACE_07]lab…!"
[NEWPAGE]
Esper: I'd like to help you guys
in exchange for saving me… [LONGPAUSE]
But esper law demands that I
test your strength first.
[NEWPAGE]
Esper: Okay! Here goes!
--------------------
Esper: Are you the ones who
saved me from that place?
[NEWPAGE]
"An esper's speaking from the
[SPACE_07]magicite…!"
[NEWPAGE]
Esper: I must thank you.
But first, I will need to
personally test your strength.
[NEWPAGE]
Esper: Let us see if you can
stand up to the magical might
of my petrifying gaze!
